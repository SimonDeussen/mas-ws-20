  abstract  = {Dynamic task allocation is an essential requirement for multi-robot
systems operating in unknown dynamic environments. It allows
robots to change their behavior in response to environmental changes
or actions of other robots in order to improve overall system performance. Emergent coordination algorithms for task allocation that
use only local sensing and no direct communication between robots
are attractive because they are robust and scalable. However, a lack
of formal analysis tools makes emergent coordination algorithms
difficult to design. In this paper we present a mathematical model
of a general dynamic task allocation mechanism. Robots using this
mechanism have to choose between two types of tasks, and the goal
is to achieve a desired task division in the absence of explicit communication and global knowledge. Robots estimate the state of the
environment from repeated local observations and decide which task
to choose based on these observations. We model the robots and ob-
servations as stochastic processes and study the dynamics of the col-
lective behavior. Specifically, we analyze the effect that the number
of observations and the choice of the decision function have on the
performance of the system. The mathematical models are validated
in a multi-robot multi-foraging scenario. The model’s predictions
agree very closely with results of embodied simulations.},

  abstract  = {Using robots to harvest sweet peppers in protected cropping environments hasremained unsolved despite considerable effort by the research community overseveral decades. In this paper, we present the robotic harvester, Harvey, designedfor sweet peppers in protected cropping environments that achieved a 76.5%success rate on 68 fruit (within a modified scenario) which improves upon our priorwork which achieved 58% on 24 fruit and related sweet pepper harvesting workwhich achieved 33% on 39 fruit (for their best tool in a modified scenario). Thisimprovement was primarily achieved through the introduction of a novel pedunclesegmentation system using an efficient deep convolutional neural network, in con-junction with three‐dimensional postfiltering to detect the critical cutting location.We benchmark the peduncle segmentation against prior art demonstratingan improvement in performance with aF1score of 0.564 compared to 0.302. Therobotic harvester uses a perception pipeline to detect a target sweet pepper and anappropriate grasp and cutting pose used to determine the trajectory of a multimodalharvesting tool to grasp the sweet pepper and cut it from the plant. A noveldecoupling mechanism enables the gripping and cutting operations to be performedindependently. We perform an in‐depth analysis of the full robotic harvesting systemto highlight bottlenecks and failure points that future work could address.},

Among themulti-robot approaches, swarm robotics stresses aspectslike flexibility, scalability and robustness in solving complextasks, and is considered very relevant for precision farmingand large-scale agricultural applications. However, swarmrobotics research is still confined into the lab, and no ap-plication in the field is currently available. In this paper,we describe a roadmap to bring swarm robotics to the fieldwithin the domain of weed control problems. This roadmapis implemented within the experiment SAGA, founded withinthe context of the ECORD++ EU Project. Together with theexperiment concept, we introduce baseline results for thetarget scenario of monitoring and mapping weed in a fieldby means of a swarm of UAVs},

  abstract  = {Task allocation is an important aspect of many multi-robot systems. The features and complexity of multi-robot task allo-
cation (MRTA) problems are dictated by the requirements of the particular domain under consideration. These problems
can range from those involving instantaneous distribution of simple, independent tasks among members of a homogenous
team, to those requiring the time-extended scheduling of complex interrelated multi-step tasks for members of a heteroge-
nous team related by several constraints. The existing widely used taxonomy for task allocation in multi-robot systems was
designed for problems with independent tasks and does not deal with problems with interrelated utilities and constraints.
While that taxonomy was a ground-breaking contribution to the MRTA literature, a survey of recent work in MRTA reveals
that it is no longer a sufficient taxonomy, due to the increasing importance of interrelated utilities and constraints in
realistic MRTA problems under consideration. Thus, in this paper, we present a new, comprehensive taxonomy, iTax, that
explicitly takes into consideration the issues of interrelated utilities and constraints. Our taxonomy maps categories of
MRTA problems to existing mathematical models from combinatorial optimization and operations research, and hence
draws important parallels between robotics and these fields.},

On average,localization success was 85%, detachment success was 75%, harvest success was 66%, fruit damage was 5%,peduncle damage was 45%, and cycle time was 33 s. A kiwi harvesting robot achieved the shortest cycle timeof 1 s. Moreover, the performance of harvesting robots did not improve in the past three decades, and noneof these 50 robots was commercialized. Four future challenges with R&D directions were identified to realizea positive trend in performance and to successfully implement harvesting robots in practice: (1) simplifyingthe task, (2) enhancing the robot, (3) defining requirements and measuring performance, and (4) consideringadditional requirements for successful implementation. This review article may provide new directions forfuture automation projects in high-value crops},

systems, important theoretical aspects of multi-robot coordination
mechanisms have, to date, been largely untreated. To address this
issue, we focus on the problem of multi-robot task allocation (MRTA).
Most work on MRTA has been ad hoc and empirical, with many
coordination architectures having been proposed and validated in a
proof-of-concept fashion, but infrequently analyzed. With the goal of
bringing objective grounding to this important area of research, we
present a formal study of MRTA problems. A domain-independent
taxonomy of MRTA problems is given, and it is shown how many
such problems can be viewed as instances of other, well-studied,
optimization problems. We demonstrate how relevant theory from
operations research and combinatorial optimization can be used for
analysis and greater understanding of existing approaches to task
allocation, and to show how the same theory can be used in the
synthesis of new approaches.},
