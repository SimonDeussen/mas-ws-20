\section{Reading Report: \emph{Crop design for improved robotic harvesting: A case study of sweet pepper harvesting}}
\cite{Herck2020}

\subsection*{Abstract}
Current harvesting robots have limited performance, due to the unstructured and dynamic
nature of both the target crops and their environment. Efforts to date focus on improving
sensing and robotic systems. This paper presents a parallel approach, to ‘design’ the crop
and its environment to best fit the robot, similar to robotic integration in industrial robot
deployments.
A systematic methodology to select and modify the crop ‘design’ (crop and environ-
ment) to improve robotic harvesting is presented. We define crop-dependent robotic fea-
tures for successful harvesting (e.g., visibility, reachability), from which associated crop
features are identified (e.g., crop density, internode length). Methods to influence the crop
features are derived (e.g., cultivation practices, climate control) along with a methodo-
logical approach to evaluate the proposed designs. A case study of crop ‘design’ for robotic
sweet pepper harvesting is presented, with statistical analyses of influential parameters.
Since comparison of the multitude of existing crops and possible modifications is impos-
sible due to complexity and time limitations, a sequential field experimental setup is
planned. Experiments over three years, 10 cultivars, two climate control conditions, two
cultivation techniques and two artificial illumination types were performed. Results
showed how modifying the crop effects the crops characteristics influencing robotic har-
vesting by increased visibility and reachability. The systematic crop ‘design’ approach also
led to robot design recommendations. The presented ‘engineering’ the crop ‘design’
framework highlights the importance of close synergy between crop and robot design
achieved by strong collaboration between robotic and agronomy experts resulting in
improved robotic harvesting performance.

\subsection*{Questions}
\subsubsection*{What are the motivations for this work?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item One of the main factors limiting the performance of robots in agriculture is the unstructured and dynamic environment. 
    To reduce this, the authors created a case study to \emph{engineer} a improved crop-\emph{design} at the example of sweet peppers.
    \item Similar to using a robot in an industrial environment, a greenhouse should also be optimized towards the robot. Much research works the other way around, but it is important to go both ways.
    \item The authors want to present a systematic methodology to select and modify crops for an improved harvesting.
    \item Improved greenhouse and crop design will directly result in a better performance of the used robotic systems.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{What is the proposed solution?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item In  this study, the authors they describe experiments run during 3 years in a greenhouse in the Netherlands.
    \item They tested different varieties of sweet peppers and described which conditions are desireable for automatic harvesting and robotic help.
    \item Overall they authors propose a framework for an engi approach to crop design.
    \item The authors described following performance indicators which depend in the crop design: \begin{itemize}
        \item Fruit location success
        \item Detachment success
        \item Harvest success
        \item Damage rate
    \end{itemize}
    \item The proposed methodology also includes following characteristics of the crops: \begin{description}
        \item[Visibility] This is the percentage of total fruit area without occlusion
        \item[Reachability] The free space around the fruits in which the robot can freely move its manipulator.
        \item[Graspability] Measure for the quality of the pose of the fruit. "The grasping point should lie within the part of the fruit that points away from the plant stem."
        \item[Detachability] How easy it it for the manipulator to detach the fruit from the plant.
    \end{description}
    \item To modify the crops, the authors propose following methods: \
    \begin{description}
        \item[Selection of suitable varieties] The openess and fruit density highly depends on an suitable selected crop
        \item[Cultivation technique] This strongly impacts many aspects like the visibility and reachability of the fruit. Here the crops are altered by removing leaves and/or young fruits.
        \item[Climate control] \
        \begin{description}
            \item[Temperature] The authors suggest that higher temperatures in the mornings result in longer internodes and fruit stemps.
            \item[Humidity] Higher realtive humidity should also result in better characteristics: Better internodes and thus easier fruits to harvest mechanically.
            \item[$CO_2$ concentration] Higher $CO_2$ concentration should yield a decrease in leaf surface area and so an improved fruit visibility. Which then results in more harvested fruits. 
        \end{description}
        \item[Additional growing lights] Some research the authors cite, says that an higher amount of blue  light could result in more open plants with longer internodes.
    \end{description}
    \item The last category the authors suggested are the crop measures. Those allow to compare the resulting crops in perspective of the robotic harvesting. \
    \begin{description}
        \item[Crop density] This a value between 0-100\% describing how easy it is to look through the crop.  
        \item[Lenth of internodes] This describes the lenth of an segment between two leaves. A longer internode usually results in an easier approach for
         the robot and thus better harvesting. 
        \item[Position of the fruit on the stem] Since fruits hanging towards the robot are easier to harvest, this value describes the axis between the
         gripper and the fruit to harvest.
        \item[Estimation of successfull harvesting] This is an estimation based around the space around the fruits. 
        \item[Production] This is calculated based on how many fruits are harvested in $\frac{kg}{m^2}$   
    \end{description}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{What is the work`s evaluation of the solution?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The authors manged to create a feasible recommendation for growing sweet peppers in a greenhouse. The recommendation includes varieties of peppers, and a special cultivation method.
    \item Unfortunately climate control is not showing a positive outcome so this is not recommended because it decreases the yield.
    \item Using additional grow lights did not yield improvements for the harvestability of the crops here is additional research needed.
    \item The authors also said that it is important to deepen the research in the choosing of harvesting method.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{What is my analysis of the identified problem, idea  and evaluation?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The concrete results are not as impressive as initial thought
    \item The highly methodic approach resulting from collaboration with domain experts on the other hand is really important and should be noted.
    \item I really like the approach of engineering a optimal greenhouse and crop design for simplifying the robotic work - I will follow the authors and also deepen my research in this area.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{What are the contributions?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item An in-depth methodology for describing and choosing a crop and its environment to grow it in to maximize robotic help in the whole growing process.
    \item They also have a concrete recommendation on how to culticate red and yellow peppers for optimal robotic conditions.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{What are the future directions of the research?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item They will continue to find optimal conditions for peppers and also other crops.
    \item It is also mentioned to include moving platforms in the next steps,
    \item Next to improving the greenhouse and crop conditions they want to research the effect of a smaller end-effector for grasping the produce.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{What questions have I left?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The next step would be of course to build peppers and other crop-varieties with optimal characteristics. Would be interesting to follow the breeding and engineering of such species
    \item For me the exact definition of some of the measurements are not clear. How are exactly is the crop density calculated?
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{What is my main take away from this paper?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Engineering crops and greenhouse environments for optimal robotic help is a great idea. This will go hand in hand with designing better robots.
    \item Robots profit most from plant where the fruits are easy to recognize and grasp. This is measured in the crop density.
    \item It is also easier for robots to grasp fruits when they hang freely.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Summary}
Interesting and detailed case study for which crop characteristics are needed to make robots the live easier. Shocker: Its open crops with free hanging fruits! The proposed methodology is great tough!

\section{Reading Report: \emph{Heterogeneous Multi-Robot System for Mapping Environmental Variables of Greenhouses}}
\cite{Roldan2016}

\subsection*{Abstract}
The productivity of greenhouses highly depends on the environmental conditions of crops,
such as temperature and humidity. The control and monitoring might need large sensor networks,
and as a consequence, mobile sensory systems might be a more suitable solution. This paper describes
the application of a heterogeneous robot team to monitor environmental variables of greenhouses.
The multi-robot system includes both ground and aerial vehicles, looking to provide flexibility
and improve performance. The multi-robot sensory system measures the temperature, humidity,
luminosity and carbon dioxide concentration in the ground and at different heights. Nevertheless,
these measurements can be complemented with other ones (e.g., the concentration of various
gases or images of crops) without a considerable effort. Additionally, this work addresses some
relevant challenges of multi-robot sensory systems, such as the mission planning and task allocation,
the guidance, navigation and control of robots in greenhouses and the coordination among ground
and aerial vehicles. This work has an eminently practical approach, and therefore, the system has
been extensively tested both in simulations and field experiments.


\subsection*{Keywords}

\subsection*{Questions}
\subsubsection*{What are the motivations for this work?}
\begin{itemize} 
    \item The crop output of a greenhouse is a result of strongly controlled climate and conditions. 
    \item To keep the conditions of a greenhouse in optimal levels, high definition sensor data is needed. This allows will allow local climate control and product traceability.
    \item Equipping large-scale greenhouses with sensors to monitor data is so expensive that it is often not possible in a high spatial resolution.
    \item Instead of having multiple stationary sensors, this paper proposes to use mobile robots equipped with sensors instead.
    \item For creating a model of the greenhouse the papers proposes using following variables:\begin{description}
        \item[Input Variables]  \ 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Ventilation system
            \item Heating system
            \item Fogging system
            \item Shading screens
        \end{itemize}
        \item[Output variables]   \ 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Air temperature
            \item Air humidity
            \item Solar radiation
            \item ($CO_2$ concentration) not mentioned in the listing of the paper but used anyways
        \end{itemize}
        \item[External disturbances]\ 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item External Temperature
            \item External humidity
            \item Wind speed
            \item Wind direction
            \item Solar radiation
            \item External $CO_2$ concentration
            \item Cover temperature
            \item Crop temperature
            \item Soil temperature 
        \end{itemize}
    \end{description}
    \item The authors also mentioned several advantages of using wireless sensor networks for monitoring like flexibility, 
    modularity and fault tolerance. But having a mobile platform can be cheaper and even more robust then the stationary sensors. 
    And one could also use the robots for tasks like spraying and harvesting.
\end{itemize}
    \subsubsection*{What is the proposed solution?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The solution consists of a two robot system. One four-wheel drive unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) robot and one unmanned ground vehicle (UAV). The UAV sits on top of the ground robot until its needed.
    \item Both robots are equipped with: \begin{itemize}
        \item 2D-cameras
        \item Temperature sensor
        \item Humidity sensor
        \item Luminosity sensor
        \item $CO_2$ sensor
    \end{itemize}
    \item The goal of the duo is to drive trough the whole greenhouse using a \emph{back-and-forth} strategy.
    \item When ever the path is blocked, the UAV starts and continues to monitor the rows. UAV and UGV meet after the blocked row is monitored. 
    \item This allows the UAV to recharge and to be ready for the next blockage.
    \item Both the UGV and UAV are off-the-shelf commercially available hardware. The UAV uses a RaspberryPie for computation.
    \item In this paper, they are evaluating the strategic partnership between the two robots, \textbf{but the UAV is tele-operated!}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{What is the work`s evaluation of the solution?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The basic idea is, that the UAV can be deployed whenever the path is blocked for the UGV. A commercial greenhouse has a structured layout of rows so the team can meet up at the next crossing.
    \item Without the UAV the UGV would have to make a detour resulting in a longer runtime and more battery usage.
    \item Inside different simulated test environments the system archived a performance uplift between 8\% and 23\%.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{What is my analysis of the identified problem, idea  and evaluation?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The idea main idea is really great and progressive. The concrete implementations are good steps in this direction but lack of real benefits.
    \item Having multiple robots patrol a greenhouse on a regular basis to get high definition spatial and lower definition temporal data has have many benefits over installing 
    a sensor grid in the same spatial dimension. Moving robots can continually measure values while moving but will measure every given point only once per round trip. Combining this
    with a couple of stationary sensors could yield in an even better modelling of the local climates.
    \item The solution from the authors is a little disappointing. On the one hand their evaluation is a result of a simulation and one small real greenhouse. On the other hand,
    the system is not autonomous. The UAV needs to be tele-operated which is a let down. I hope in future research the UAV can fly by itself.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{What are the contributions?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Build a platform from off-the-shelf hardware for mobile monitoring of temperature, humidity, luminosity and $CO_2$ concentration.
    \item The authors contribute a simulation system build in \emph{Unity3D 5.2.1} for simulating the behavior of the dual robot system. 
    \item The robot system consists of a UAV sitting on top the UGV which gets deployed as soon as the way is blocked which happends often in real world greenhouses.
    \item But they do not provide algorithms for flying the UAV. This is done manually by hand.
    \item Navigation algorithm for the UGV using SLAM and ACML.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{What are the future directions of the research?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item They want to make the UAV fly by itself
    \item Testing it in real world greenhouses is also scheduled
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{What questions have I left?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item My main concern is the tele-operated drone. This has to get improved in future work: can a UAV fly properly in a cluttered and narrow environment.
    \item When having a self-flying drone, would it be better to use the combination of UAV and UGV instead of only using a UAV?
    \item How precise can one model the local climates from this kind of data? (High spatial and low temporal resolution)
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{What is my main take away from this paper?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Great idea to get critical environment data from mobile sensors, but the climate modelling aspect has to be researched even more.
    \item Heterogeneous robot cooperation is really interesting! I wish to learn more about the task and motion planning involved to get a system like this properly running.
    \item 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Summary}
UGV transporting a UAV for a spontaneous deployment if the path is blocked - amazing idea! The concrete implementations is a bit disappointing but good written paper anyway.

\section{Reading Report: \emph{Development of a tomato harvesting robot used in greenhouse}}
\cite{Lili2017}

\subsection*{Abstract}
A tomato harvesting robot was developed in this study, which consisted of a four-wheel independent steering system,
a 5-DOF harvesting system, a navigation system, and a binocular stereo vision system.
The four-wheel independent steering system was capable of providing a low-speed steering control of the robot based on Ackerman steering geometry.
The proportional-integral-derivative (PID) algorithm was used in the laser navigation control system. The Otsu algorithm and the
elliptic template method were used for the automatic recognition of ripe tomatoes, and obstacle avoidance strategies were
proposed based on the C-space method. The maximum average absolute error between the set angle and the actual angle was
about 0.14°, and the maximum standard deviation was about 0.04°.  The laser navigation system was able to rapidly and
accurately track the path, with the deviation being less than 8 cm.  The load bearing capacity of the mechanical arm was about
1.5 kg. The success rate of the binocular vision system in the recognition of ripe tomatoes was 99.3\%.
When the distance was less than 600 mm, the positioning error was less than 10 mm.
The time needed for recognition of ripe tomatoes and pitching was about 15 s per tomato, with a success rate of about 86\%. 
This study provides some insights into the development and application of tomato harvesting robot used in the greenhouse.


\subsection*{Keywords}
tomato harvesting robot, four-wheel independent steering, automatic navigation, binocular stereo vision system,
obstacle avoidance, greenhouse

\subsection*{Questions}

\subsubsection*{What are the motivations for this work?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Harvesting tomatoes is a very popular and labour intensive vegetable. The annual production is around 60 million tons. 
    \item Because the labor costs are rising - even in China they are trying to find a autonomous solution which can scale up.
    \item Tomatoes are very soft and sensitive vegetables so harvesting them is especially complicated.
    \item The authors name several other research in building this kind of harvesting robots, but those have slow reaction and clumsy movement. 
    \item They want to create a fast system for picking tomatoes in greenhouses
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{What is the proposed solution?} 
\begin{itemize}
    \item A robot system capable of : \begin{itemize}
        \item Automatic navigation
        \item Recognition of ripeness
        \item Detecting the exact position of the ripe fruits
        \item Avoiding obstacles.
    \end{itemize}
    \item The solution also contains a image recognition algorithm and a picking control method.
    \item The shown robot has a four-wheel drive with independent steering. The 4 wheels are controlled using and Ackermann steering model.
    \item It detects tomatoes using a stereo-vision camera with a resolution of 1384×1032px
    \item The pathfinding is done by using a laser scanner
    \item To pick the ripe tomatoes, the robot has a 4-DOF mechanical arm with a 1-DOF end-effector 
    \item After picking the tomatoes the robot outs them into a crate on its back.
    \item The total mass of the robot is 540 kg and it reaches an maximum speed of 3.6 km/h.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{What is the work`s evaluation of the solution?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The authors evaluated every part of their system: \begin{itemize}
        \item The controlling of the \textbf{steering angle} resulted in an average error of 0.14° with a standard deviation of 0.04°.
        \item \textbf{Path tracking by the navigation system} could track the correct path with a deviation of less than 8cm. 
        \item They also evaluated how much weight the \textbf{mechanical arm} the \textbf{end-effector} can carry without loosing precision. When using weights up to 1kg no big
        deviation is measured. So the mechanical system is fit for its main goal of manipulating tomatoes.
        \item Inside the greenhouse the \textbf{camera-system} has to detect the tomatoes. Here the authors measured a success rate of over 99.3\% in a sample size of 300.
        \item The position of the tomatoes got detected correctly with an average positioning error of less than 10mm in a range of 600mm.
        \item Finally the \textbf{picking rate} of the robot was measured to be 87\% in a sample size of 100 tomatoes. The robot needs 15 seconds from recognition to pitching the tomatoes.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{What is my analysis of the identified problem, idea  and evaluation?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item This paper contains multiple system working together for a common goal. It showcases the steps needed to make the robot drive through a greenhouse and pick tomatoes.
    \item The error and performance analyses is detailed. Only thing lacking is an in-depth breakdown of the task times. The only time measurement in the paper is the 15 seconds from recognition to picking - but how long does the robot need to pick 100 tomatoes? 
    \item Tomato picking has the advantage that tomatoes are easy to detect via camera. A disadvantage is the soft nature of the fruits.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{What are the contributions?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Algorithm to track the path inside a greenhouse using laser scanner 
    \item Control architecture for the mechanical arm using a collision free A*-algorithm.
    \item Tomato detection and localisation algorithms using stereo vision
    \item In-depth error analysis.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{What are the future directions of the research?} 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Improving the success rate and overall speed.
    \item Using this system to other crops.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{What questions have I left?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item They left out some key metrics like time breakdown and total time needed. So I would like to know if this system is even fast enough for a commercial consideration
    \item I have not fully understand how the collision free path finding algorithm for the end-effector works, so this is something to study next.
    \item Currently the robot is only following along the space in between two rows in a greenhouse. It would be great to add additional navigation systems for a a fully automated operation.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{What is my main take away from this paper?} 
\begin{itemize}
    \item The localisation in a greenhouse for tomatoes works good enough to grap them.  I did not expect for this to work that good.
    \item This paper is a good study of a holistic robot system working in the chaotic environment of a greenhouse.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Summary}
This paper is a good study of a holistic robot system working in the chaotic environment of a greenhouse. But some key performance indicator are missing, even some already mentioned in the introduction. 
In the motivation section of the paper they said that other systems would be too slow but did not deliver they own number. Nevertheless a good study and nice read.

\section{Reading Report: \emph{Field Test of an Autonomous Cucumber Picking Robot}}
\cite{Henten2003}

\subsection*{Abstract}
At the Institute of Agricultural and Environmental Engineering (IMAG B.V.) an autonomous harvesting
robot for cucumbers was developed and tested in a greenhouse in autumn 2001. Analysis of the harvest
process had revealed that at a 2 ha Dutch production facility four robots are needed to replace the skilled
human work force during the peak season. Then assuming a success rate of 100\%, a harvest cycle might take
at most 10 s per cucumber fruit. In this paper the results of the field test of the harvesting robot are reported
and analysed in view of the performance criteria mentioned above. Cucumbers (Cucumis sativus cv. Korinda)
were grown in a high-wire cultivation system. In four independent experiments the robot was tested. The
average success rate was 74.4\%. The majority of failures originated from inaccurate positioning of the end-
effector at the stalk of the fruit. It was found to be a great advantage that the system was able to perform
several harvest attempts on a single cucumber from different harvest positions of the robot. This improved the
success rate considerably. A single successful harvest cycle took 65.2 s per cucumber. Since not all attempts
were successful, a cycle time of 124 s per harvested cucumber was measured under practical circumstances. The
test confirmed the ability to harvest more than one cucumber using a single set of images which reduced the
cycle time of a successful harvest to 56.7 and 53.0 s if two or three cucumbers were harvested. To bridge the
gap between the measured performance and the design specifications, future research focuses on improving the
success rate, faster hardware and software for image processing and motion planning as well as the reduction
of the motion time of the manipulator.


\subsection*{Keywords} Harvesting, Computer Vision, Machine Vision, Stereo Vision, Experiment

\subsection*{Questions}
\subsubsection*{What are the motivations for this work?}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The authors wanted to create a comparable solution to recent advances in harvesting tomatoes and eggplants
    \item Human labour fir harvesting is a tedious and expensive task.
    \item Robot labour needs to be able to harvest one cucumber every 10 seconds. This experiment tries to show the current (2001) limitations.
    \item Inside high-wire greenhouses mobile robots can move along tracks next to the cucumber plants which creates a somehow structured environment.
    \item This proposed architecture should allow complete autonomous harvesting.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{What is the proposed solution?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mobile system consisting of a robotic arm having a thermal cutter and a suction cup for cutting and grabbing the cucumbers. One camera for taking two
    images (768x512px) at different positions to find 3D coordinates.
    \item They restricted the way to cucumbers could grow so that they are always in a specific range reachable for the robots manipulators.
    \item Removed leaves before hand to lessen occlusion errors.
    \item They also removed cucumbers growing too close to each other.
    \item The systems moves along a rail in 33cm steps. At each step the cameras look for cucumbers and if found and big enough proceed with the harvesting.
    \item The harvesting does not take additional images. All informations come from the initial 2 pictures. Even if multiple cucumbers are found, the initial information and processing has to be enough.
    \item Because the range of the system is around 1m, the 33cm step allow up to 3 harvest attempts for each cucumber.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{What is the work`s evaluation of the solution?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item For this experiment the authors took in-depth runtime measurements and error protocols.
    \item On average the system managed to harvest ca. 75\% of a present cucumbers. 
    \item For the whole experiment with multiple attempts and failures, the resulting harvesting time was \textbf{124s} per cucumber!!!
    \item If every first attempt would have been successful, the resulting time would have been   \textbf{75s} per harvested cucumber.
    \item Most errors (ca. 36\%) came from an misplaced end-effector resulting from poor 3D coordinates.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{What is my analysis of the identified problem, idea  and evaluation?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Those experiments (20 years ago) have been one order of magnitude too slow for a commercial application.
    \item I like the idea of using only one camera, but the extra cost would directly result in a speed up which would basically pay for itself to use a stereo camera.
    \item The evaluation was very good. The authors managed to create an details overview over the shortcomings. 
    \item Especially the failure categorization is great. This should be an inspiration for similar failure reports for my own experiments.
    \item I was surprised that the paper was that old.
    \item 10 seconds runtime for the image analysis will be much faster nowadays.
\end{itemize}

\section{Reading Report: Chapter 56 \emph{Robotics in Agriculture and Forestry} from \emph{Springer Handbook of Robotics}}
\cite{Siciliano2016}

\subsection*{Abstract}
Robotics for agriculture and forestry (A\&F) represents the ultimate application of one of our
society’s latest and most advanced innovations to its most ancient and important industries.
Over the course of history, mechanization and automation increased crop output several orders of
magnitude, enabling a geometric growth in population and an increase in quality of life across
the globe. Rapid population growth and rising incomes in developing countries, however, 
require ever larger amounts of A\&F output. This chapter addresses robotics for A\&F in the form
of case studies where robotics is being success fully applied to solve well-identified problems.
With respect to plant crops, the focus is on the in-field or in-farm tasks necessary to guarantee
a quality crop and, generally speaking, end at harvest time. In the livestock domain, the focus
is on breeding and nurturing, exploiting, harvesting, and slaughtering and processing. The chapter
is organized in four main sections. The first one explains the scope, in particular, what aspects
of robotics for A\&F are dealt with in the chapter. The second one discusses the challenges and
opportunities associated with the application of robotics to A\&F. The third section is the core of
the chapter, presenting twenty case studies that showcase (mostly) mature applications of robotics
in various agricultural and forestry domains. The case studies are not meant to be comprehensive 
but instead to give the reader a general overview of how robotics has been applied to
A\&F in the last 10 years. The fourth section concludes the chapter with a discussion on specific
improvements to current technology and paths to commercialization.

\section{Reading Report: \emph{Plant detection and mapping for agricultural robots using a 3D LIDAR sensor}}
\cite{Weiss2011}

\subsection*{Abstract}

In this article, we discuss the advantages of MEMS based 3D LIDAR sensors over traditional approaches
like vision or stereo vision in the domain of agricultural robotics and compare these kinds of sensors
with typical 3D sensors used on mobile robots. Further, we present an application for such sensors. This
application deals with the detection and segmentation of plants and ground, which is one important
prerequisite to perform localization, mapping and navigation for autonomous agricultural robots. We
show the discrimination of ground and plants as well as the mapping of the plants. Experiments conducted
using the FX6 LIDAR by Nippon Signal were carried out in the simulation environment Gazebo, with
artificial maize plants in the laboratory and on a small maize field. Our results show that the tested plants
can be reliably detected and segmented from ground, despite the use of the low resolution FX6 sensor.
Further, the plants can be localized with high accuracy.


\subsection*{Keywords}
Individual plant detection, Plant mapping, 3D LIDAR sensor, Agricultural robotics


\subsection*{Questions}

\subsubsection*{What are the motivations for this work?} 
A key problem in agricultural robots is to detect and map individual plants for several reasons, including 
navigation, individual reports and individual care. For a robust plant mapping it is needed to use reliable
sensors and algorithms. Much research is done in solving this problem 
using 2D and 3D cameras but this paper on the other hand, works on detecting plants using low cost and low resolution
3D Lidar sensors. 
\subsubsection*{What is the proposed solution?}
The solution contains an algorithm for detecting individual plant in a row using a FX6 3D Lidar sensor. 
This sensor is still in development, the current version has a resolution of 29 by 59 pixel creating 15 frames per second.
To detect the plant from the resulting point cloud, the algorithm first detects the ground plane and second  
creates cluster for each plants using a k,d tree and decides for each cluster only using the bounding box dimensions.
\subsubsection*{What is the work`s evaluation of the solution?}
The proposed algorithm works seemingly fast, and manages to identify in a single frame 60\% of the plants
and using multiple frames with tracking it scores an average detection accuracy of 80-90\%. Further the average accuracy 
of the position detection is 3 centimeters. One problem occurring repeatedly is that the algorithm fails to differentiate
between the next plants if they grow into each other and the cluster connect. 

\subsubsection*{What is my analysis of the identified problem, idea  and evaluation?}
The idea to use a low cost 3D sensor is quite good because, as mentioned in the paper, it works independent from 
existing lighting and is robust against fog and dust - conditions which occur frequently in the real world.
The algorithm uses only a bounding box of a cluster to determine the position of the plant. This approach works okay 
when every plant grows neatly far away from their neighbours but fails in messy real world conditions.
Some aspects are great on the other hand, it has a fast runtime, for example. I think this given approach would work 
better on a row basis and maybe use offline compute power to identify the individual plants? 
Because measuring these plants is a repeated operation, one could leverage the result of a computational more expensive
offline algorithm and map the online point cloud directly onto an existing map.
\subsubsection*{What are the contributions?}
This main contribution is an evaluation of a low-cost 3D lidar scanner with an basic point clustering algorithm in real time. besides
that they also showcase other approaches for the same problem using traditional 2D camera systems and different scanners.

\subsubsection*{What are the future directions of the research?}
The future research will include using stronger machine learning algorithms for clustering and plant separation. They also
want to work on a row detection basis.
\subsubsection*{What questions have I left?}
My main concern was the quite simple simulation model on gazebo and i hope that they improve this.
\subsubsection*{What is my main take away from this paper?}
It is possible to detect plants in real time using point clouds in the agricultural sector even with 
simple mathematical methods. The difference between a classical and those FX6 laser scanner is also interesting.
I think plant detection like this is the way to go, by improving only the algorithm it should be possible
soon to deploy at least field scouting robots in real world scenarios. 

\subsection*{Summary}
In depth paper for clustering point clouds into individual plants using a bounding box approach.
Maths is explained nicely, can be used to build something similar.

\section{Reading Report: \emph{Agricultural robots for field operations: Concepts and components}}
\cite{Bechar2016}

\subsection*{Abstract}

This review investigates the research effort, developments and innovation in agricultural
robots for field operations, and the associated concepts, principles, limitations and gaps.
Robots are highly complex, consisting of different sub-systems that need to be integrated
and correctly synchronized to perform tasks perfectly as a whole and successfully transfer
the required information. Extensive research has been conducted on the application of
robots and automation to a variety of field operations, and technical feasibility has been
widely demonstrated. Agricultural robots for field operations must be able to operate in
unstructured agricultural environments with the same quality of work achieved by cur-
rent methods and means. To assimilate robotic systems, technologies must be developed
to overcome continuously changing conditions and variability in produce and environ-
ments. Intelligent systems are needed for successful task performance in such environ-
ments. The robotic system must be cost-effective, while being inherently safe and
reliabled human safety, and preservation of the environment, the crop and the machinery
are mandatory. Despite much progress in recent years, in most cases the technology is not
yet commercially available. Information-acquisition systems, including sensors, fusion
algorithms and data analysis, need to be adjusted to the dynamic conditions of un-
structured agricultural environments. Intensive research is needed on integrating human
operators into the system control loop for increased system performance and reliability.
System sizes should be reduced while improving the integration of all parts and com-
ponents. For robots to perform in agricultural environments and execute agricultural
tasks, research must focus on: fusing complementary sensors for adequate localisation
and sensing abilities, developing simple manipulators for each agricultural task, devel-
oping path planning, navigation and guidance algorithms suited to environments besides
open fields and known a-priori, and integrating human operators in this complex and
highly dynamic situation.

\subsection*{Questions}

\subsubsection*{What are the motivations for this work?}
The main subject of this paper is to show the current development, ideas and problems in the field of agricultural 
robotics. This review paper explains first the background, then the economic feasibility and furthers goes into 
concepts, principles and components.
\subsubsection*{What is the proposed solution?} 
The paper concludes, that with current technologies the broad usage in commercial farming is not possible yet and 
proposes to focus research on a number of fields. Those fields include sensor fusion for better localisation, 
engineering of better simple manipulators and the development of specific path planning, navigation and guidance algorithms
for agriculture.
\subsubsection*{What is the work`s evaluation of the solution?}
This question is not applicable.
\subsubsection*{What is my analysis of the identified problem, idea  and evaluation?}
The authors make a great job in displaying the current technologies and their limitations. With this knowledge it is 
easy to identify a subproblem to work on.
\subsubsection*{What are the contributions?}
Several points come to the mind. Firstly they create an in-depth background needed to understand the need of automated
systems in agriculture, but also explain why it is so hard to create such systems. 
They propose a categorization of robotic system after the structure of their environment and object of interest. Both 
can be either structured or unstructured. This categorization creates four different categories. First, a structured 
environment and a structured object: This is the industrial domain. Second, a strucutred environment and a unstructured
object: the medial domain. Further there is the unstructured enviroment with a structured object: the military, space, underwater
and mining domains. The last domain, unstructured in environment and object of interest is the agricultural domain.

The next contribution are guidelines under which circumstances a robot can be commercially successful. These guideline conclude
that it is possible to start using robots even if the costs are the same as conventional methods if the work of
the robots create more steady and predictable processes.

A big part of the review are categorization concepts, components and principles. These include Human-Robot-Systems versus
Autonomous Robot Systems. In the component section the authors underline following topics: steering and mobility, 
sensing and self-localization, path planning and guidance and last but not least, manipulators and effectors.
\subsubsection*{What are the future directions of the research?}
This question is not applicable.
\subsubsection*{What questions have I left?}
Many questions, this paper is an excellent basis for further research.
\subsubsection*{What is my main take away from this paper?}
One of the main problems is the highly dynamic environment and the need to react fast to unprecedented situations.
This creates the question on how to define behavior in such a way to allow and strengthen the capabilities of 
improvisation.
\subsection*{Summary}
In-depth review paper with some self citations but besides that it gives many new points to deepen my reseach.

\section{Reading Report: \emph{Agricultural robots—system analysis and economic feasibility}}
\cite{Pedersen2006}

\subsection*{Abstract}
This  paper focuses  on  the  economic  feasibility of  applying  autonomous robotic  vehicles  compared  to  conventional  systems  in  three  different  applications: robotic weeding in high value crops (particularly sugar beet), crop scouting in cereals and grass cutting on golf courses. The comparison was based on a systems analysis and an individual economic feasibility study for each of the three applications. The results  showed  that  in  all  three  scenarios,  the  robotic  applications  are  more  economically feasible than the conventional systems. The high cost of real time kinematics Global Positioning System (RTK-GPS) and the small capacity of the vehicles are the main parameters that increase the cost of the robotic systems.

\subsection*{Keywords}
Agricultural robots, Grass cutter, Autonomous vehicles, Economics, Feasibility study, Robotic weeding, Crop scouting

\subsection*{Questions}

\subsubsection*{What are the motivations for this work?}
The papers main focus lies on displaying the cost reduction possible by utilizing 
autonomous system for agriculture tasks. Most agricultural task can not use individual-plant-based solutions with
conventional methods. By using robots and big data processing it will be possible to care for each plant individually.
Taking care of an identified weed patch for example will need much less herbicides than spaying the whole field preemptively.
\subsubsection*{What is the proposed solution?}
The authors propose solutions for using autonomous robots for field scouting - the identification and localisation 
of growing weeds -, intra-row and near-crop weeding and automated grass cutting. 
\subsubsection*{What is the work`s evaluation of the solution?}
In all scenarios the authors showcase a reduction in primary and secondary costs in comparison to conventional methods.
\begin{description}
    \item[Field scouting] 20\% cost reduction in labor and secondary benefits of the data because it is now possible to only deploy herbicides where needed.
    \item[Weeding] Only by reducing the cost of the navigation system by half it is possible to save 12-21\% or manuel costs. and reduction of herbicide use of 90\%   
    \item[Grass cutting] Reduction of cost of 52\% (but only when paying the gardener 27 Euro per hour, lol) 
\end{description}
\subsubsection*{What is my analysis of the identified problem, idea  and evaluation?}
The usage of automated systems for growing crops is one of the key points in reducing the environmental footprint
of large scale agriculture. The three analyzed areas are great entry points for deploying such systems. Especially 
the field scouting and the automated weeding are very interesting. For the evaluation the authors compared 
the costs of the components with average conventional costs witch is mostly reasonable, expect the estimated
labor cost of the gardener of 27 Euros per hour for grass cutting.
\subsubsection*{What are the contributions?}
The ideas of the authors in breaking down the cost of the robots into several components are very helpful to estimate economic costs of different system for
this usage. The main contribution is this economic analysis which helped to spark more research in this direction.
\subsubsection*{What are the future directions of the research?}
There will always be economic analyses for newer technology.  
\subsubsection*{What questions have I left?}
Because this paper is from 2006 I am eager to find a similar, more current breakdown.
\subsubsection*{What is my main take away from this paper?}
That it is feasible to automate many agricultural tasks with almost existing technology.

\subsection*{Summary}
Great in depth analysis but dated (2006), has good numbers for conventional cost estimates.
\subsection*{Rating}
