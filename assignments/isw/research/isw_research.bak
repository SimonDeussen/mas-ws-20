  abstract = {Swarm intelligence (SI) is concerned with the collective behaviour that emerges from decentralised self-organising systems, whilst swarm robotics (SR) is an approach to the self-coordination of large numbers of simple robots which emerged as the application of SI to multi-robot systems. Given the increasing severity and frequency of occurrence of wildfires and the hazardous nature of fighting their propagation, the use of disposable inexpensive robots in place of humans is of special interest. This paper demonstrates the feasibility and potential of employing SR to fight fires autonomously, with a focus on the self-coordination mechanisms for the desired firefighting behaviour to emerge. Thus, an efficient physics-based model of fire propagation and a self-organisation algorithm for swarms of firefighting drones are developed and coupled, with the collaborative behaviour based on a particle swarm algorithm adapted to individuals operating within physical dynamic environments of high severity and frequency of change. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed self-organising system is effective, scalable and fault-tolerant, comprising a promising approach to dealing with the suppression of wildfires – one of the world's most pressing challenges of our time.},

  abstract = {Search and rescue (SAR) is one of the foremost issues in disaster management. A robust SAR mechanism can significantly reduce the number of causalities. This paper presents a behavior-based model for a swarm of small robots to perform an efficient SAR operation in an unknown environment. The swarm is guided by a dynamically selected virtual leader (VL). A self-contained dynamic goal-seeking mechanism, using behavior-based approach, is designed to search targets (victims). Under the leadership of VL, the proposed model retains the integrity of the swarm while driving it from its current position to referenced goals. Fuzzy logic has been used to design constituent behavioral modules, namely obstacle avoidance, alignment, and inter-robot cohesion. The model has been simulated to validate its efficiency and the findings reveal that robots moving as a swarm are more effective in the SAR process as compared to multiple single robots.},

  abstract = {Collective behaviours such as swarm formations of autonomous agents offer the advantages of efficient movement, redundancy, and potential for human guidance of a single swarm organism. This paper proposes a developmental approach to evolving collective behaviours whereby the evolutionary process is guided by a novel value system. A self-organising map is used at the core of this value system and motion properties of the swarm entities are used as input. Unlike traditional approaches, this value system does not need in advance the precise characteristics of the intended behaviours. We examine the performance of this value system in a series of controlled experiments. Our results demonstrate that the value system can recognise multiple “interesting” structured collective behaviours and distinguish them from random movement patterns. Results show that our value system is most effective distinguishing structured behaviours from random behaviours when using motion properties of individual agents as input. Further variations and modifications to input data such as normalisation and aggregation were also investigated, and it was shown that certain configurations provide better results in distinguishing collective behaviours from random ones.},

  abstract = {Robotics have experienced a meteoric growth over the last decades, reaching unprecedented levels of distributed intelligence and self-autonomy. Today, a myriad of real-world scenarios can benefit from the application of robots, such as structural health monitoring, complex manufacturing, efficient logistics or disaster management. Related to this topic, there is a paradigm connected to Swarm Intelligence which is grasping significant interest from the Computational Intelligence community. This branch of knowledge is known as Swarm Robotics, which refers to the development of tools and techniques to ease the coordination of multiple small-sized robots towards the accomplishment of difficult tasks or missions in a collaborative fashion. The success of Swarm Robotics applications comes from the efficient use of smart sensing, communication and organization functionalities endowed to these small robots, which allow for collaborative information sensing, operation and knowledge inference from the environment. The numerous industrial and social applications that can be addressed efficiently by virtue of swarm robotics unleashes a vibrant research area focused on distributing intelligence among autonomous agents with simple behavioral rules and communication schedules, yet potentially capable of realizing the most complex tasks. In this context, we present and overview recent contributions reported around this paradigm, which serves as an exemplary excerpt of the potential of Swarm Robotics to become a major research catalyst of the Computational Intelligence arena in years to come.},

  abstract = {It is difficult for swarm robots to allocate tasks efficiently by self-organization in a dynamicunknown environment. The computational cost of swarm robots will be significantly increased forlarge-scale tasks, and the unbalanced task allocation of robots will also lead to a decrease in systemefficiency. To address these issues, we propose a dynamic task allocation method of swarm robotsbased on optimal mass transport theory.  The problem of large-scale tasks is solved by groupingswarm robots to complete regional tasks.  The task reallocation mechanism realizes the balancedtask allocation of individual robots.  This paper solves the symmetric assignment between robotand task and between the robot groups and the regional tasks.  Our simulation and experimentalresults demonstrate that the proposed method can make the swarm robots self-organize to allocatelarge-scale dynamic tasks effectively. The tasks can also be balanced allocated to each robot in theswarm of robots.},

The  application  considered in  this  context  is  the  foraging  application  which  can  be addressed  as  a  searching  job  followed  by  a  transportation job. The  near-optimal  allocation  scheme  is  found  by  using the  Particle  swarm  optimization  (PSO)  technique  to  handle the whole task execution in a minimal time. Two case studies have  been  considered using  different  swarm  sizes  and  the implemented   code   has   been   executed   for   a   distinctive number   of   iterations.   A   stability   proof   for   the   PSO technique’s  parameters  choices  is  presented.  Simulation results  were  verified  by  comparing  the  proposed  algorithm with   the   simulated   annealing   optimization   technique   in terms  of  computational  time,  number  of  iterations  needed and  quality  of  solution  to  demonstrate  the  robustness  and efficiency of the algorithm.},

Following up on previous work, we identify the symmetry parameter, a measure of the progress of the swarm towards a decision, as a fundamental integrated swarm property and formulate its time evolution as a continuous-time Markov process. Contrary to previous work, which justified this approach only empirically and a posteriori, we justify it from first principles and derive hard limits on the parameter regime in which it is applicable.},

  abstract = {An alternative to deploying a single robot of high complexity can be to utilise robot swarms comprising large numbers of identical, and much simpler, robots. Such swarms have been shown to be adaptable, fault-tolerant and widely applicable. However, designing individual robot algorithms to ensure effective and correct overall swarm behaviour is actually very difficult. While mechanisms for assessing the effectiveness of any swarm algorithm before deployment are essential, such mechanisms have traditionally involved either computational simulations of swarm behaviour, or experiments with robot swarms themselves. However, such simulations or experiments cannot, by their nature, analyse all possible swarm behaviours. In this paper, we will develop and apply the use of automated probabilistic formal verification techniques to robot swarms, involving an exhaustive mathematical analysis, in order to assess whether swarms will indeed behave as required. In particular we consider a foraging robot scenario to which we apply probabilistic model checking.},

  abstract = {The use of aerial swarms to solve real-world problems has been increasing steadily, accompanied by falling prices and improving performance of communication, sensing, and processing hardware. The commoditization of hardware has reduced unit costs, thereby lowering the barriers to entry to the field of aerial swarm robotics. A key enabling technology for swarms is the family of algorithms that allow the individual members of the swarm to communicate and allocate tasks amongst themselves, plan their trajectories, and coordinate their flight in such a way that the overall objectives of the swarm are achieved efficiently. These algorithms, often organized in a hierarchical fashion, endow the swarm with autonomy at every level, and the role of a human operator can be reduced, in principle, to interactions at a higher level without direct intervention. This technology depends on the clever and innovative application of theoretical tools from control and estimation. This paper reviews the state of the art of these theoretical tools, specifically focusing on how they have been developed for, and applied to, aerial swarms. Aerial swarms differ from swarms of ground-based vehicles in two respects: they operate in a three-dimensional space and the dynamics of individual vehicles adds an extra layer of complexity. We review dynamic modeling and conditions for stability and controllability that are essential in order to achieve cooperative flight and distributed sensing. The main sections of this paper focus on major results covering trajectory generation, task allocation, adversarial control, distributed sensing, monitoring, and mapping. Wherever possible, we indicate how the physics and subsystem technologies of aerial robots are brought to bear on these individual areas.},

  abstract = {Swarm intelligence (SI) algorithms, including ant colony optimization, particle swarm optimization, bee-inspired algorithms, bacterial foraging optimization, firefly algorithms, fish swarm optimization and many more, have been proven to be good methods to address difficult optimization problems under stationary environments. Most SI algorithms have been developed to address stationary optimization problems and hence, they can converge on the (near-) optimum solution efficiently. However, many real-world problems have a dynamic environment that changes over time. For such dynamic optimization problems (DOPs), it is difficult for a conventional SI algorithm to track the changing optimum once the algorithm has converged on a solution. In the last two decades, there has been a growing interest of addressing DOPs using SI algorithms due to their adaptation capabilities. This paper presents a broad review on SI dynamic optimization (SIDO) focused on several classes of problems, such as discrete, continuous, constrained, multi-objective and classification problems, and real-world applications. In addition, this paper focuses on the enhancement strategies integrated in SI algorithms to address dynamic changes, the performance measurements and benchmark generators used in SIDO. Finally, some considerations about future directions in the subject are given.},

Comprehensive learning (CL) strategy is used to generate the exemplars for both subpopulations. In the exploration-subpopulation, the exemplars are generated by using personal best experiences of the particles in the exploration-subpopulation itself. In the exploitation-subpopulation, the personal best experiences of the entire swarm population are used to generate the exemplars. As the exploration-subpopulation does not learn from any particles in the exploitation-subpopulation, the diversity in the exploration-subpopulation can be retained even if the exploitation-subpopulation converges prematurely.

  abstract  = {This paper presents a decoupled path planning based on ant colony algorithm and distributed navigation with collision avoidance for multi-robot systems. An improved ant colony algorithm is proposed to plan a reasonable collision-free path for each mobile robot of multi-robot system in the decoupled path planning scheme in complicated static environment. The special functions are added into the regular ant colony algorithm to improve the selective strategy. When an ant explores a dead-corner in path searching, a dead-corner table is established and a penalty function is used for the trail intensity updated in order to avoid the path deadlock of mobile robot. A behavior strategy on "first come and first service" is adopted to solve the conflict between moving robots in distributed local navigation. Simulation results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the performance of the planned path, and the individual robots with collision-free can achieve to reach their goal locations by the simple local navigation strategies},

  abstract  = {Driving heavy tractors and agricultural machinery on soil for growing plants causes more permanent damage to the soil than was previously believed. Compacting the soil severely deteriorates soil fertility leading to poor crop yields and increased population from agricultural lands. In addition, compacted soils require many years of expensive treatment to recover their fertility. Soil compaction problem can be solved by replacing heavy tractors and machinery with a number of smaller and lighter vehicles that is capable of treating crop fields as well as heavy ones without compacting the soil. However, this scenario is impractical because of the high operating cost to secure a human operator/driver for each vehicle. A practical solution is to replace heavy tractors and machinery by a set of autonomous vehicles that require minimum or no human intervention. In this paper, the technology required to enable a single farmer to supervise and operate a team of automated vehicles, is proposed. This will include the development of a Mission Control Center and Intelligent Coverage Path Planning algorithms to enable team/swarm of autonomous vehicles to communicate and cooperate and solve a range of agricultural tasks in a safe and efficient way.},

In this letter, we present an automated robotic system for fast, precise, and noninvasive measurements using a new deep-learning-based next-best view planning pipeline. Specifically, we first use a deep neural network to estimate a set of candidate voxels for the next scanning. Next, we cast rays from these voxels to determine the optimal viewpoints. We empirically evaluate our method in simulations and real-world robotic experiments with up to three robotic arms to demonstrate its efficiency and effectiveness. One advantage of our new pipeline is that it can be easily extended to a multi-robot system where multiple robots move simultaneously according to the planned motions. Our system significantly outperforms the single robot in flexibility and planning time. High-throughput phenotyping can be made practically.},

  abstract = {Heterogeneous multi-robot system is one of the most important research directions in the robotic field. Real-time path planning for heterogeneous multi-robot system under unknown 3D environment is a new challenging research and a hot spot in this field. In this paper, an improved real-time path planning method is proposed for a heterogeneous multi-robot system, which is composed of many unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). In the proposed method, the 3D environment is modelled as a neuron topology map, based on the grid method combined with the bio-inspired neural network. Then a new 3D dynamic movement model for multi-robots is established based on an improved Dragonfly Algorithm (DA). Thus, the movements of the robots are optimized according to the activities of the neurons in the bio-inspired neural network to realize the real-time path planning. Furthermore, some simulations have been carried out. The results show that the proposed method can effectively guide the heterogeneous UAV/UGV system to the target, and has better performance than traditional methods in the real-time path planning tasks.},

  abstract = {This review investigates the research effort, developments and innovation in agricultural robots for field operations, and the associated concepts, principles, limitations and gaps. Robots are highly complex, consisting of different sub-systems that need to be integrated and correctly synchronised to perform tasks perfectly as a whole and successfully transfer the required information. Extensive research has been conducted on the application of robots and automation to a variety of field operations, and technical feasibility has been widely demonstrated. Agricultural robots for field operations must be able to operate in unstructured agricultural environments with the same quality of work achieved by current methods and means. To assimilate robotic systems, technologies must be developed to overcome continuously changing conditions and variability in produce and environments. Intelligent systems are needed for successful task performance in such environments. The robotic system must be cost-effective, while being inherently safe and reliable—human safety, and preservation of the environment, the crop and the machinery are mandatory. Despite much progress in recent years, in most cases the technology is not yet commercially available. Information-acquisition systems, including sensors, fusion algorithms and data analysis, need to be adjusted to the dynamic conditions of unstructured agricultural environments. Intensive research is needed on integrating human operators into the system control loop for increased system performance and reliability. System sizes should be reduced while improving the integration of all parts and components. For robots to perform in agricultural environments and execute agricultural tasks, research must focus on: fusing complementary sensors for adequate localisation and sensing abilities, developing simple manipulators for each agricultural task, developing path planning, navigation and guidance algorithms suited to environments besides open fields and known a-priori, and integrating human operators in this complex and highly dynamic situation.},
