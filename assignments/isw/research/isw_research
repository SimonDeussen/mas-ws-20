  abstract = {Swarm intelligence (SI) is concerned with the collective behaviour that emerges from decentralised self-organising systems, whilst swarm robotics (SR) is an approach to the self-coordination of large numbers of simple robots which emerged as the application of SI to multi-robot systems. Given the increasing severity and frequency of occurrence of wildfires and the hazardous nature of fighting their propagation, the use of disposable inexpensive robots in place of humans is of special interest. This paper demonstrates the feasibility and potential of employing SR to fight fires autonomously, with a focus on the self-coordination mechanisms for the desired firefighting behaviour to emerge. Thus, an efficient physics-based model of fire propagation and a self-organisation algorithm for swarms of firefighting drones are developed and coupled, with the collaborative behaviour based on a particle swarm algorithm adapted to individuals operating within physical dynamic environments of high severity and frequency of change. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed self-organising system is effective, scalable and fault-tolerant, comprising a promising approach to dealing with the suppression of wildfires – one of the world's most pressing challenges of our time.},

  abstract = {Search and rescue (SAR) is one of the foremost issues in disaster management. A robust SAR mechanism can significantly reduce the number of causalities. This paper presents a behavior-based model for a swarm of small robots to perform an efficient SAR operation in an unknown environment. The swarm is guided by a dynamically selected virtual leader (VL). A self-contained dynamic goal-seeking mechanism, using behavior-based approach, is designed to search targets (victims). Under the leadership of VL, the proposed model retains the integrity of the swarm while driving it from its current position to referenced goals. Fuzzy logic has been used to design constituent behavioral modules, namely obstacle avoidance, alignment, and inter-robot cohesion. The model has been simulated to validate its efficiency and the findings reveal that robots moving as a swarm are more effective in the SAR process as compared to multiple single robots.},

  abstract = {Collective behaviours such as swarm formations of autonomous agents offer the advantages of efficient movement, redundancy, and potential for human guidance of a single swarm organism. This paper proposes a developmental approach to evolving collective behaviours whereby the evolutionary process is guided by a novel value system. A self-organising map is used at the core of this value system and motion properties of the swarm entities are used as input. Unlike traditional approaches, this value system does not need in advance the precise characteristics of the intended behaviours. We examine the performance of this value system in a series of controlled experiments. Our results demonstrate that the value system can recognise multiple “interesting” structured collective behaviours and distinguish them from random movement patterns. Results show that our value system is most effective distinguishing structured behaviours from random behaviours when using motion properties of individual agents as input. Further variations and modifications to input data such as normalisation and aggregation were also investigated, and it was shown that certain configurations provide better results in distinguishing collective behaviours from random ones.},

  abstract = {Robotics have experienced a meteoric growth over the last decades, reaching unprecedented levels of distributed intelligence and self-autonomy. Today, a myriad of real-world scenarios can benefit from the application of robots, such as structural health monitoring, complex manufacturing, efficient logistics or disaster management. Related to this topic, there is a paradigm connected to Swarm Intelligence which is grasping significant interest from the Computational Intelligence community. This branch of knowledge is known as Swarm Robotics, which refers to the development of tools and techniques to ease the coordination of multiple small-sized robots towards the accomplishment of difficult tasks or missions in a collaborative fashion. The success of Swarm Robotics applications comes from the efficient use of smart sensing, communication and organization functionalities endowed to these small robots, which allow for collaborative information sensing, operation and knowledge inference from the environment. The numerous industrial and social applications that can be addressed efficiently by virtue of swarm robotics unleashes a vibrant research area focused on distributing intelligence among autonomous agents with simple behavioral rules and communication schedules, yet potentially capable of realizing the most complex tasks. In this context, we present and overview recent contributions reported around this paradigm, which serves as an exemplary excerpt of the potential of Swarm Robotics to become a major research catalyst of the Computational Intelligence arena in years to come.},

  abstract = {It is difficult for swarm robots to allocate tasks efficiently by self-organization in a dynamicunknown environment. The computational cost of swarm robots will be significantly increased forlarge-scale tasks, and the unbalanced task allocation of robots will also lead to a decrease in systemefficiency. To address these issues, we propose a dynamic task allocation method of swarm robotsbased on optimal mass transport theory.  The problem of large-scale tasks is solved by groupingswarm robots to complete regional tasks.  The task reallocation mechanism realizes the balancedtask allocation of individual robots.  This paper solves the symmetric assignment between robotand task and between the robot groups and the regional tasks.  Our simulation and experimentalresults demonstrate that the proposed method can make the swarm robots self-organize to allocatelarge-scale dynamic tasks effectively. The tasks can also be balanced allocated to each robot in theswarm of robots.},

  year     = {2017},
  abstract = {This  paper  discusses  a  solution  to  one  of  the  key issues in the swarm robotics field which is the dynamic task allocation  problem  in  which  a group  of  robots  needs  to  be allocated to a set of tasks scattered in the environment in an efficient  and  decentralized  way.  The  application  considered in  this  context  is  the  foraging  application  which  can  be addressed  as  a  searching  job  followed  by  a  transportation job. The  near-optimal  allocation  scheme  is  found  by  using the  Particle  swarm  optimization  (PSO)  technique  to  handle the whole task execution in a minimal time. Two case studies have  been  considered using  different  swarm  sizes  and  the implemented   code   has   been   executed   for   a   distinctive number   of   iterations.   A   stability   proof   for   the   PSO technique’s  parameters  choices  is  presented.  Simulation results  were  verified  by  comparing  the  proposed  algorithm with   the   simulated   annealing   optimization   technique   in terms  of  computational  time,  number  of  iterations  needed and  quality  of  solution  to  demonstrate  the  robustness  and efficiency of the algorithm.},
