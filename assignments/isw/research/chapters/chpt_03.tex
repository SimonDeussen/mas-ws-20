    \chapter{Conclusions}

    \cite{deSantos2016} presents a strongly coordinated approach utilizing a heterogeneous team of UAV scouts and UGV controlled from a base station and human operator.\cite{Albani2017} tries a swarm robotics approach for more efficient behaviour of UAV scouts. Both works are about weeds scouting, mapping and eradication.
