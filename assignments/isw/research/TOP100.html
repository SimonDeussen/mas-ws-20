	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: In this study, we propose a novel technique for imaging of crops. Related work has significant limitations in terms of resolution as well as coverage in space and time. In order to overcome these limitations, we use a dense sampling of high-resolution images, which enables the creation of a sequence of 3D reconstructions over time, i.e., a 4D spatio-temporal model of a crop as it develops. To this end, we mounted a CCD camera with integrated GPS and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) on a ground articulated tractor, and we collected a set of images approximately once per week over staggered plantings of broccoli from October to January in South Georgia. Multiple images of individual plants taken from different angles are stitched together to produce a 3D reconstruction each week, using "Structure from Motion" (SFM) techniques from computer vision. These 3D reconstructions are then combined in a 4D GIS to show the plants growth and production of fruit over time (4D). These 4D imaging techniques can be applied to images collected from autonomous ground or aerial vehicles for multiple site-specific management practices, such as estimating where, when and how many fruit are ready for harvest in certain vegetable and fruit crops. Other potential applications include record keeping of canopy development for orchards, measuring rate of change of leaf area index, and weed dispersal, proliferation and identification.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Stress in crops is one of the major concerns in precision agriculture because it indicates the emergence of disease and damage in plants. Detecting the stress condition of a plant early is critical. A system that can monitor the condition of plants is a desirable solution. In this work, Collaborative Control Theory is utilized to construct a new system, ARS (agricultural robotic system) which synchronizes humans, a mobile robot, and a variable set of sensors to effectively perform the monitoring and detection tasks. A key protocol for that system, which combines routing algorithm, adaptive search algorithm, and collaboration control framework has been developed and validated, and is presented in this article. By using greenhouse as a case study structure, the protocol routes a robot to visit the sampled locations by using a genetic algorithm. In addition, the search algorithm can be guided by the predictive characteristics of the crops’ stress, which can spread to other plants according to sunlight, airflow direction, and other known conditions. Based on simulation experiments, the results indicate with statistical significance that (1) the routing algorithm increases the number of successful detections of existing stressed plants by 45.77% compared to monitoring without this routing algorithm. (2) The adaptive search algorithm improves the number of successful detections of stressed plants by 71.88% compared to a system without the adaptive search algorithm. (3) The new protocol developed in this research yields the highest overall robotic efficiency, compared with a system without collaborative control framework.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Task allocation is an important aspect of many multi-robot systems. The features and complexity of multi-robot task allo-<br>cation (MRTA) problems are dictated by the requirements of the particular domain under consideration. These problems<br>can range from those involving instantaneous distribution of simple, independent tasks among members of a homogenous<br>team, to those requiring the time-extended scheduling of complex interrelated multi-step tasks for members of a heteroge-<br>nous team related by several constraints. The existing widely used taxonomy for task allocation in multi-robot systems was<br>designed for problems with independent tasks and does not deal with problems with interrelated utilities and constraints.<br>While that taxonomy was a ground-breaking contribution to the MRTA literature, a survey of recent work in MRTA reveals<br>that it is no longer a sufficient taxonomy, due to the increasing importance of interrelated utilities and constraints in<br>realistic MRTA problems under consideration. Thus, in this paper, we present a new, comprehensive taxonomy, iTax, that<br>explicitly takes into consideration the issues of interrelated utilities and constraints. Our taxonomy maps categories of<br>MRTA problems to existing mathematical models from combinatorial optimization and operations research, and hence<br>draws important parallels between robotics and these fields.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Driving heavy tractors and agricultural machinery on soil for growing plants causes more permanent damage to the soil than was previously believed. Compacting the soil severely deteriorates soil fertility leading to poor crop yields and increased population from agricultural lands. In addition, compacted soils require many years of expensive treatment to recover their fertility. Soil compaction problem can be solved by replacing heavy tractors and machinery with a number of smaller and lighter vehicles that is capable of treating crop fields as well as heavy ones without compacting the soil. However, this scenario is impractical because of the high operating cost to secure a human operator/driver for each vehicle. A practical solution is to replace heavy tractors and machinery by a set of autonomous vehicles that require minimum or no human intervention. In this paper, the technology required to enable a single farmer to supervise and operate a team of automated vehicles, is proposed. This will include the development of a Mission Control Center and Intelligent Coverage Path Planning algorithms to enable team/swarm of autonomous vehicles to communicate and cooperate and solve a range of agricultural tasks in a safe and efficient way.</td>

Different forces belonging to other robots, obstacles and the aspired shape of formation are combined and used to move each robot to its desired position inside the formation. While moving in formation, the group is able to avoid obstacles and approach towards a specified target.

Numerous approaches have been suggested for the navigation of mobile robots with moving obstacles. In this paper, about 80 articles have been reviewed and briefly described to offer an outline of the research progress in motion planning of mobile robot approaches in dynamic environments for the last five years. The benefits and drawbacks of each article are also explained. These papers are classified based on their issues into ten groups which are: smooth path, safety, path length, run time, accuracy, stability, less computation cost, control, efficiency, and future prediction (uncertainties). Finally, some challenging topics are presented based on the papers mentioned.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Swarm intelligence (SI) algorithms, including ant colony optimization, particle swarm optimization, bee-inspired algorithms, bacterial foraging optimization, firefly algorithms, fish swarm optimization and many more, have been proven to be good methods to address difficult optimization problems under stationary environments. Most SI algorithms have been developed to address stationary optimization problems and hence, they can converge on the (near-) optimum solution efficiently. However, many real-world problems have a dynamic environment that changes over time. For such dynamic optimization problems (DOPs), it is difficult for a conventional SI algorithm to track the changing optimum once the algorithm has converged on a solution. In the last two decades, there has been a growing interest of addressing DOPs using SI algorithms due to their adaptation capabilities. This paper presents a broad review on SI dynamic optimization (SIDO) focused on several classes of problems, such as discrete, continuous, constrained, multi-objective and classification problems, and real-world applications. In addition, this paper focuses on the enhancement strategies integrated in SI algorithms to address dynamic changes, the performance measurements and benchmark generators used in SIDO. Finally, some considerations about future directions in the subject are given.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Nowadays, multi-robot systems are being utilized to perform agricultural tasks. It is particularly essential to robotize pesticide spraying because of the risk of poisoning workers. However, the problem is that the human-driven sprayers are big size, and difficult to maneuver in many orchards. Therefore, heavy spraying robots must be replaced with lighter robots. Also, it takes a lot of times to perform spraying using only one sprayer in a large orchard. To achieve this goal, the multi-robot system (MRS) can be applied to the spraying by robot cooperation to improve performance. In this study, we developed a task allocation system based on a Voronoi diagram for a multi-robot spraying system in an orchard. The seed point for area partition using the Voronoi diagram was obtained through node clustering using a k-means clustering algorithm. In the experiment, workspaces were partitioned according to the number of robots, from 2 to 10. A total of four metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the system. The results confirmed that our task allocation system is applicable to real orchards.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This review investigates the research effort, developments and innovation in agricultural robots for field operations, and the associated concepts, principles, limitations and gaps. Robots are highly complex, consisting of different sub-systems that need to be integrated and correctly synchronised to perform tasks perfectly as a whole and successfully transfer the required information. Extensive research has been conducted on the application of robots and automation to a variety of field operations, and technical feasibility has been widely demonstrated. Agricultural robots for field operations must be able to operate in unstructured agricultural environments with the same quality of work achieved by current methods and means. To assimilate robotic systems, technologies must be developed to overcome continuously changing conditions and variability in produce and environments. Intelligent systems are needed for successful task performance in such environments. The robotic system must be cost-effective, while being inherently safe and reliable—human safety, and preservation of the environment, the crop and the machinery are mandatory. Despite much progress in recent years, in most cases the technology is not yet commercially available. Information-acquisition systems, including sensors, fusion algorithms and data analysis, need to be adjusted to the dynamic conditions of unstructured agricultural environments. Intensive research is needed on integrating human operators into the system control loop for increased system performance and reliability. System sizes should be reduced while improving the integration of all parts and components. For robots to perform in agricultural environments and execute agricultural tasks, research must focus on: fusing complementary sensors for adequate localisation and sensing abilities, developing simple manipulators for each agricultural task, developing path planning, navigation and guidance algorithms suited to environments besides open fields and known a-priori, and integrating human operators in this complex and highly dynamic situation.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This part of our review of the research, developments and innovation in agricultural robotsfor field operations, focuses on characteristics, performance measures, agricultural tasks andoperations. The application of robots to a variety of field operations has been widelydemonstrated. A key feature of agricultural robots is that they must operate in unstructuredenvironments without impairing the quality of work currently achieved. Designs, de-velopments and evaluations of agricultural robots are diverse in terms of objectives, struc-tures, methods, techniques, and sensors. Standardisation of terms, system-performancemeasures and methodologies, and adequacy of technological requirements are vital forcomparing robot performance and technical progress. Factors limiting commercialisationand assimilation of agricultural autonomous robot systems are unique to each system and toeach task. However, some common gaps need to be filled to suit unstructured, dynamic en-vironments; e.g. poor detection performance, inappropriate decision-making and low actionsuccess rate. Research and development of versatile and adaptive algorithms, integrated intomulti-sensor platforms, is required. Cycle time must be reduced and production rateincreased to justify economic use. Improved wholeness or integration of all sub-systems willenable sustainable performance and complete task operation. Research must focus on eachof these gaps and factors that limit commercialisation of agricultural robotics. Researchneeds to focus on the field use of autonomous or humanerobot systems, the latter being areasonable step toward fully autonomous robots. More robust, reliable information-acquisition systems, including sensor-fusion algorithms and data analysis, should besuited to the dynamic conditions of unstructured agricultural environments.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Comment</b>: The papers main focus lies on displaying the cost reduction possible by utilizingautonomous system for agriculture tasks.  Most agricultural task can not useindividual-plant-based  solutions  with  conventional  methods.   By  using  robotsand big data processing it will be possible to care for each plant individually.Taking care of an identified weed patch for example will need much less herbi-cides than spaying the whole field preemptively.<br>The authors propose solutions for using autonomous robots for field scouting -the identification and localisation of growing weeds -, intra-row and near-cropweeding and automated grass cutting.<br>In all scenarios the authors showcase a reduction in primary and secondary costsin comparison to conventional methods.<p>Field scouting:20% cost reduction in labor and secondary benefits of the databecause it is now possible to only deploy herbicides where needed.<br>Weeding:Only  by  reducing  the  cost  of  the  navigation  system  by  half  it  ispossible to save 12-21% or manuel costs.  and reduction of herbicide useof 90%.<br>Grass cutting:Reduction of cost of 52% (but only when paying the gardener27 Euro per hour, lol)<p>The usage of automated systems for growing crops is one of the key points inreducing the environmental footprint of large scale agriculture.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Heterogeneous multi-robot system is one of the most important research directions in the robotic field. Real-time path planning for heterogeneous multi-robot system under unknown 3D environment is a new challenging research and a hot spot in this field. In this paper, an improved real-time path planning method is proposed for a heterogeneous multi-robot system, which is composed of many unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). In the proposed method, the 3D environment is modelled as a neuron topology map, based on the grid method combined with the bio-inspired neural network. Then a new 3D dynamic movement model for multi-robots is established based on an improved Dragonfly Algorithm (DA). Thus, the movements of the robots are optimized according to the activities of the neurons in the bio-inspired neural network to realize the real-time path planning. Furthermore, some simulations have been carried out. The results show that the proposed method can effectively guide the heterogeneous UAV/UGV system to the target, and has better performance than traditional methods in the real-time path planning tasks.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: An alternative to deploying a single robot of high complexity can be to utilise robot swarms comprising large numbers of identical, and much simpler, robots. Such swarms have been shown to be adaptable, fault-tolerant and widely applicable. However, designing individual robot algorithms to ensure effective and correct overall swarm behaviour is actually very difficult. While mechanisms for assessing the effectiveness of any swarm algorithm before deployment are essential, such mechanisms have traditionally involved either computational simulations of swarm behaviour, or experiments with robot swarms themselves. However, such simulations or experiments cannot, by their nature, analyse all possible swarm behaviours. In this paper, we will develop and apply the use of automated probabilistic formal verification techniques to robot swarms, involving an exhaustive mathematical analysis, in order to assess whether swarms will indeed behave as required. In particular we consider a foraging robot scenario to which we apply probabilistic model checking.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Dynamic task allocation is an essential requirement for multi-robot<br>systems operating in unknown dynamic environments. It allows<br>robots to change their behavior in response to environmental changes<br>or actions of other robots in order to improve overall system performance. Emergent coordination algorithms for task allocation that<br>use only local sensing and no direct communication between robots<br>are attractive because they are robust and scalable. However, a lack<br>of formal analysis tools makes emergent coordination algorithms<br>difficult to design. In this paper we present a mathematical model<br>of a general dynamic task allocation mechanism. Robots using this<br>mechanism have to choose between two types of tasks, and the goal<br>is to achieve a desired task division in the absence of explicit communication and global knowledge. Robots estimate the state of the<br>environment from repeated local observations and decide which task<br>to choose based on these observations. We model the robots and ob-<br>servations as stochastic processes and study the dynamics of the col-<br>lective behavior. Specifically, we analyze the effect that the number<br>of observations and the choice of the decision function have on the<br>performance of the system. The mathematical models are validated<br>in a multi-robot multi-foraging scenario. The model’s predictions<br>agree very closely with results of embodied simulations.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Crop yield estimation is an important task in apple orchard management. The current manual sampling-based yield estimation is time-consuming, labor-intensive and inaccurate. To deal with this challenge, we developed a computer vision-based system for automated, rapid and accurate yield estimation. The system uses a two-camera stereo rig for image acquisition. It works at nighttime with controlled artificial lighting to reduce the variance of natural illumination. An autonomous orchard vehicle is used as the support platform for automated data collection. The system scans both sides of each tree row in orchards. A computer vision algorithm detects and registers apples from acquired sequential images, and then generates apple counts as crop yield estimation. We deployed the yield estimation system in Washington state in September, 2011. The results show that the system works well with both red and green apples in the tall-spindle planting system. The crop yield estimation errors are -3.2% for a red apple block with about 480 trees, and 1.2% for a green apple block with about 670 trees.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Collective behaviours such as swarm formations of autonomous agents offer the advantages of efficient movement, redundancy, and potential for human guidance of a single swarm organism. This paper proposes a developmental approach to evolving collective behaviours whereby the evolutionary process is guided by a novel value system. A self-organising map is used at the core of this value system and motion properties of the swarm entities are used as input. Unlike traditional approaches, this value system does not need in advance the precise characteristics of the intended behaviours. We examine the performance of this value system in a series of controlled experiments. Our results demonstrate that the value system can recognise multiple “interesting” structured collective behaviours and distinguish them from random movement patterns. Results show that our value system is most effective distinguishing structured behaviours from random behaviours when using motion properties of individual agents as input. Further variations and modifications to input data such as normalisation and aggregation were also investigated, and it was shown that certain configurations provide better results in distinguishing collective behaviours from random ones.</td>

In this paper, we have presented a system-of-systems approach to design and development of a mobile robotic platform for agricultural applications. Similar to other field robots, the mobile platform for agricultural applications requires a different set of predefined attributes for its operation. We have designed, fabricated, and demonstrated the mobile platform for pesticide spraying application. The design and development includes synergistic integration of mechanical, sensor and actuator, navigational and control, and electronic and software interfacings. The autonomous navigation aspect of the development was achieved via three stages: learning stage, implementation stage (training stage), and testing stage. In the learning stage, we defined the path patterns and studied and recorded the behavior of the vehicle in real-world environment. In the training stage, various steering algorithms for four-wheel driving system were developed and inherent errors were compensated using advanced tools and methods. In the testing stage, we put the robotic platform on an arbitrary path pattern and demonstrated its success in autonomous navigation. The medium-sized mobile robot can be commercialized for greenhouse-based agricultural operations.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Field operations should be done in a manner that minimizes time and travels over the field surface and is coordinated with topographic land features. Automated path planning can help to find the best coverage path so that the field operation costs can be minimized. Intelligent algorithms are desired for both two‐dimensional (2D) and three‐dimensional (3D) terrain field coverage path planning. The algorithm of generating an optimized full coverage pattern for a given 2D planar field by using boustrophedon paths has been investigated and reported before. However, a great proportion of farms have rolling terrains, which have a considerable influence on the design of coverage paths. Coverage path planning in 3D space has a great potential to further optimize field operations. This work addressed four critical tasks: terrain modeling and representation, coverage cost analysis, terrain decomposition, and the development of optimized path searching algorithm. The developed algorithms and methods have been successfully implemented and tested using 3D terrain maps of farm fields with various topographic features. Each field was decomposed into subregions based on its terrain features. A recommended “seed curve” based on a customized cost function was searched for each subregion, and parallel coverage paths were generated by offsetting the found “seed curve” toward its two sides until the whole region was completely covered. Compared with the 2D planning results, the experimental results of 3D coverage path planning showed its superiority in reducing both headland turning cost and soil erosion cost. On the tested fields, on average the 3D planning algorithm saved 10.3% on headland turning cost, 24.7% on soil erosion cost, 81.2% on skipped area cost, and 22.0% on the weighted sum of these costs, where their corresponding weights were 1, 1, and 0.5, respectively. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: A 3D time‐of‐flight camera was applied to develop a crop plant recognition system for broccoli and green bean plants under weedy conditions. The developed system overcame the previously unsolved problems caused by occluded canopy and illumination variation. An efficient noise filter was developed to remove the sparse noise points in 3D point cloud space. Both 2D and 3D features including the gradient of amplitude and depth image, surface curvature, amplitude percentile index, normal direction, and neighbor point count in 3D space were extracted and found effective for recognizing these two types of plants. Separate segmentation algorithms were developed for each of the broccoli and green bean plant in accordance with their 3D geometry and 2D amplitude characteristics. Under the experimental condition where the crops were heavily infested by various types of weed plants, detection rates over 88.3% and 91.2% were achieved for broccoli and green bean plant leaves, respectively. Additionally, the crop plants were segmented out with nearly complete shape. Moreover, the algorithms were computationally optimized, resulting in an image processing speed of over 30 frames per second.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Mobile robots outfitted with a supportive tether are ideal for gaining access to extreme environments for mapping when human or remote observation is not possible. This paper is a field report covering both the development and field testing of our Tethered Robotic eXplorer (TReX) to map a steep, tree‐covered rock outcrop in a gravel mine. TReX is a mobile robot designed for the purpose of mapping extremely steep and cluttered environments for geologic and infrastructure inspection. In comparison to other systems, our design improves tethered mobility by enabling rotational freedom on steep slopes using a center‐pivoting tether management payload. To map the terrain, we leverage the rotation of an actuated tether spool with an attached two‐dimensional (2D) lidar, which rotates to both manage tether and produce 3D scans. Given that mapping requires vehicle motion, we also evaluate two existing, real‐time approaches to estimate the trajectory of the robot and rectify motion distortion from individual scans before alignment into the map: (a) a continuous‐time, lidar‐only approach that handles asynchronous measurements using a physically motivated, constant‐velocity motion prior, and (b) a method that computes visual odometry from streaming stereo images to use as a motion estimate during scan collection. Once rectified, individual scans are matched to the global map by an efficient variant of the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm. Our results include a comparison of estimated maps and trajectories to ground truth (measured by a remote survey station), an example of mapping in highly cluttered terrain, and lessons learned from the design and deployment of TReX.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Green shoot thinning in vineyards is an essential, perennial operation for main-taining canopy health and optimizing yield and quality of wine grapes. Use of me-chanized thinning system, which is essential to reduce labor dependency andassociated cost, causes high variability in shoot removal efficiency due to difficultyin precisely positioning the thinning end‐effector along cordon trajectories. Auto-mated/robotic solution for precise positioning of the thinning end‐effector couldsignificantly improve the performance and efficiency of mechanical green shootthinning. This study presents: (i) a machine vision‐based cordon detection systemthat can estimate cordon trajectories at different shoot growth stages in a vineyard;and (ii) evaluation of an integrated green shoot thinning system capable of auto-matically positioning the thinning end‐effector following vine cordon trajectories.The developed machine vision system uses deep learning‐based techniques thatcould accurately estimate cordon trajectories with root mean square error(RMSE) of 7.3, 10.3, and 16.1 pixels for canopy images captured in 2–4 weeks ofshoot growth, respectively. Then, a control strategy was presented for theintegrated system, which receives the computed cordon trajectories from machinevision system to automatically position the thinning end‐effector to cordon trajec-tories. Field evaluations in a research vineyard showed that the integrated systemcan achieve an RMSE of 1.47 cm in following the cordon trajectories at 6.6 cm·s−1forward speed. Future work will incorporate additional sensing system to detectindividual shoot on cordon and integrating it with an existing system to achievehigher level of precision in green shoot thinning.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: A multi-robot tractor system for conducting agriculture field work was developed in order to reduce total work time and to improve work efficiency. The robot tractors can form a spatial pattern, I-pattern, V-pattern or W-pattern, during the work process. The safety zones of each robot were defined as a circle and a rectangle. The robots can coordinate to turn to the next lands without collision or deadlock. The efficiency of the system depends on the number of robots, the spatial pattern, the setting distance between each robot, and the field length. Three simulations were carried out to determine the usefulness of the system. The simulation results showed that the efficiency range of three robots using the I-pattern is from 83.2% to 89.8% at a field length of 100 m. The efficiency range of seven robots using the W-pattern is from 59.4% to 65.8% at a field length of 100 m. However, the minimum efficiency of seven robots using the W-pattern is 84.9% at a field length of 500 m. The efficiency would be higher than 85% if the field length was larger than 500 m. Thus, the newly developed multi-robot tractor system is more effective in a large field.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: A tomato harvesting robot was developed in this study, which consisted of a four-wheel independent steering system,<br>a 5-DOF harvesting system, a navigation system, and a binocular stereo vision system.<br> The four-wheel independent steering<br>system was capable of providing a low-speed steering control of the robot based on Ackerman steering geometry.<br> The<br>proportional-integral-derivative (PID) algorithm was used in the laser navigation control system. The Otsu algorithm and the<br>elliptic template method were used for the automatic recognition of ripe tomatoes, and obstacle avoidance strategies were<br>proposed based on the C-space method.<br> The maximum average absolute error between the set angle and the actual angle was<br>about 0.14°, and the maximum standard deviation was about 0.04°.<br> The laser navigation system was able to rapidly and<br>accurately track the path, with the deviation being less than 8 cm.<br> The load bearing capacity of the mechanical arm was about<br>1.5 kg.<br> The success rate of the binocular vision system in the recognition of ripe tomatoes was 99.3%.<br> When the distance<br>was less than 600 mm, the positioning error was less than 10 mm.<br> The time needed for recognition of ripe tomatoes and<br>pitching was about 15 s per tomato, with a success rate of about 86%. This study provides some insights into the development<br>and application of tomato harvesting robot used in the greenhouse.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Comment</b>: What are the motivations for this work?<br>• Harvesting tomatoes is a very popular and labour intensive vegetable. The<br>annual production is around 60 million tons.<br>• Because the labor costs are rising - even in China they are trying to find<br>a autonomous solution which can scale up.<br>• Tomatoes are very soft and sensitive vegetables so harvesting them is<br>especially complicated.<br>• The authors name several other research in building this kind of harvesting<br>robots, but those have slow reaction and clumsy movement.<br>• They want to create a fast system for picking tomatoes in greenhouses<br>What is the proposed solution?<br>• A robot system capable of :<br>– Automatic navigation<br>– Recognition of ripeness<br>– Detecting the exact position of the ripe fruits<br>– Avoiding obstacles.<br>• The solution also contains a image recognition algorithm and a picking<br>control method.<br>• The shown robot has a four-wheel drive with independent steering. The<br>4 wheels are controlled using and Ackermann steering model.<br>• It detects tomatoes using a stereo-vision camera with a resolution of<br>1384×1032px<br>• The pathfinding is done by using a laser scanner<br>• To pick the ripe tomatoes, the robot has a 4-DOF mechanical arm with a<br>1-DOF end-effector<br>• After picking the tomatoes the robot outs them into a crate on its back.<br>• The total mass of the robot is 540 kg and it reaches an maximum speed<br>of 3.6 km/h.<br>What is the work‘s evaluation of the solution?<br>• The authors evaluated every part of their system:<br>– The controlling of the steering angle resulted in an average error<br>of 0.14° with a standard deviation of 0.04°.<br>– Path tracking by the navigation system could track the correct<br>path with a deviation of less than 8cm.<br>– They also evaluated how much weight the mechanical arm the end-<br>effector can carry without loosing precision. When using weights up<br>to 1kg no big deviation is measured. So the mechanical system is fit<br>for its main goal of manipulating tomatoes.<br>– Inside the greenhouse the camera-system has to detect the toma-<br>toes. Here the authors measured a success rate of over 99.3% in a<br>sample size of 300.<br>– The position of the tomatoes got detected correctly with an average<br>positioning error of less than 10mm in a range of 600mm.<br>– Finally the picking rate of the robot was measured to be 87% in<br>a sample size of 100 tomatoes. The robot needs 15 seconds from<br>recognition to pitching the tomatoes.<br>What is my analysis of the identified problem, idea and evaluation?<br>• This paper contains multiple system working together for a common goal.<br>It showcases the steps needed to make the robot drive through a green-<br>house and pick tomatoes.<br>• The error and performance analyses is detailed. Only thing lacking is an<br>in-depth breakdown of the task times. The only time measurement in the<br>paper is the 15 seconds from recognition to picking - but how long does<br>the robot need to pick 100 tomatoes?<br>• Tomato picking has the advantage that tomatoes are easy to detect via<br>camera. A disadvantage is the soft nature of the fruits.<br>What are the contributions?<br>• Algorithm to track the path inside a greenhouse using laser scanner<br>• Control architecture for the mechanical arm using a collision free A*-<br>algorithm.<br>• Tomato detection and localisation algorithms using stereo vision<br>• In-depth error analysis.<br>What are the future directions of the research?<br>• Improving the success rate and overall speed.<br>• Using this system to other crops.<br>What questions have I left?<br>• They left out some key metrics like time breakdown and total time needed.<br>So I would like to know if this system is even fast enough for a commercial<br>consideration<br>• I have not fully understand how the collision free path finding algorithm<br>for the end-effector works, so this is something to study next.<br>• Currently the robot is only following along the space in between two rows<br>in a greenhouse. It would be great to add additional navigation systems<br>for a a fully automated operation.<br>What is my main take away from this paper?<br>• The localisation in a greenhouse for tomatoes works good enough to grap<br>them. I did not expect for this to work that good.<br>• This paper is a good study of a holistic robot system working in the chaotic<br>environment of a greenhouse.<br>Summary<br>This paper is a good study of a holistic robot system working in the chaotic<br>environment of a greenhouse. But some key performance indicator are missing,<br>even some already mentioned in the introduction. In the motivation section of<br>the paper they said that other systems would be too slow but did not deliver<br>they own number. Nevertheless a good study and nice read.<br>Rating<br>3/5</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: At the Institute of Agricultural and Environmental Engineering (IMAG B.V.) an autonomous harvesting<br>robot for cucumbers was developed and tested in a greenhouse in autumn 2001. Analysis of the harvest<br>process had revealed that at a 2 ha Dutch production facility four robots are needed to replace the skilled<br>human work force during the peak season. Then assuming a success rate of 100%, a harvest cycle might take<br>at most 10 s per cucumber fruit. In this paper the results of the field test of the harvesting robot are reported<br>and analysed in view of the performance criteria mentioned above. Cucumbers (Cucumis sativus cv. Korinda)<br>were grown in a high-wire cultivation system. In four independent experiments the robot was tested. The<br>average success rate was 744%. The majority of failures originated from inaccurate positioning of the end-<br>effector at the stalk of the fruit. It was found to be a great advantage that the system was able to perform<br>several harvest attempts on a single cucumber from different harvest positions of the robot. This improved the<br>success rate considerably. A single successful harvest cycle took 652 s per cucumber. Since not all attempts<br>were successful, a cycle time of 124 s per harvested cucumber was measured under practical circumstances. The<br>test confirmed the ability to harvest more than one cucumber using a single set of images which reduced the<br>cycle time of a successful harvest to 567 and 530 s if two or three cucumbers were harvested. To bridge the<br>gap between the measured performance and the design specifications, future research focuses on improving the<br>success rate, faster hardware and software for image processing and motion planning as well as the reduction<br>of the motion time of the manipulator.</td>

On average,localization success was 85%, detachment success was 75%, harvest success was 66%, fruit damage was 5%,peduncle damage was 45%, and cycle time was 33 s. A kiwi harvesting robot achieved the shortest cycle timeof 1 s. Moreover, the performance of harvesting robots did not improve in the past three decades, and noneof these 50 robots was commercialized. Four future challenges with R&amp;D directions were identified to realizea positive trend in performance and to successfully implement harvesting robots in practice: (1) simplifyingthe task, (2) enhancing the robot, (3) defining requirements and measuring performance, and (4) consideringadditional requirements for successful implementation. This review article may provide new directions forfuture automation projects in high-value crops</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper presents a comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization algorithm with enhanced exploration and exploitation, named as “heterogeneous comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization” (HCLPSO). In this algorithm, the swarm population is divided into two subpopulations. Each subpopulation is assigned to focus solely on either exploration or exploitation. Comprehensive learning (CL) strategy is used to generate the exemplars for both subpopulations. In the exploration-subpopulation, the exemplars are generated by using personal best experiences of the particles in the exploration-subpopulation itself. In the exploitation-subpopulation, the personal best experiences of the entire swarm population are used to generate the exemplars. As the exploration-subpopulation does not learn from any particles in the exploitation-subpopulation, the diversity in the exploration-subpopulation can be retained even if the exploitation-subpopulation converges prematurely. The heterogeneous comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization algorithm is tested on shifted and rotated benchmark problems and compared with other recent particle swarm optimization algorithms to demonstrate superior performance of the proposed algorithm over other particle swarm optimization variants.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: We present a data processing pipeline to online estimate ego‐motion and build a map of the traversed environment, leveraging data from a 3D laser scanner, a camera, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Different from traditional methods that use a Kalman filter or factor‐graph optimization, the proposed method employs a sequential, multilayer processing pipeline, solving for motion from coarse to fine. Starting with IMU mechanization for motion prediction, a visual–inertial coupled method estimates motion; then, a scan matching method further refines the motion estimates and registers maps. The resulting system enables high‐frequency, low‐latency ego‐motion estimation, along with dense, accurate 3D map registration. Further, the method is capable of handling sensor degradation by automatic reconfiguration bypassing failure modules. Therefore, it can operate in the presence of highly dynamic motion as well as in the dark, texture‐less, and structure‐less environments. During experiments, the method demonstrates 0.22% of relative position drift over 9.3 km of navigation and robustness w.r.t. running, jumping, and even highway speed driving (up to 33 m/s).</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This  paper  discusses  a  solution  to  one  of  the  key issues in the swarm robotics field which is the dynamic task allocation  problem  in  which  a group  of  robots  needs  to  be allocated to a set of tasks scattered in the environment in an efficient  and  decentralized  way.  The  application  considered in  this  context  is  the  foraging  application  which  can  be addressed  as  a  searching  job  followed  by  a  transportation job. The  near-optimal  allocation  scheme  is  found  by  using the  Particle  swarm  optimization  (PSO)  technique  to  handle the whole task execution in a minimal time. Two case studies have  been  considered using  different  swarm  sizes  and  the implemented   code   has   been   executed   for   a   distinctive number   of   iterations.   A   stability   proof   for   the   PSO technique’s  parameters  choices  is  presented.  Simulation results  were  verified  by  comparing  the  proposed  algorithm with   the   simulated   annealing   optimization   technique   in terms  of  computational  time,  number  of  iterations  needed and  quality  of  solution  to  demonstrate  the  robustness  and efficiency of the algorithm.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper presents a Tracking-Error Learning Control (TELC) algorithm for precise mobile robot path tracking in off-road terrain. In traditional tracking error-based control approaches, feedback and feedforward controllers are designed based on the nominal model which cannot capture the uncertainties, disturbances and changing working conditions so that they cannot ensure precise path tracking performance in the outdoor environment. In TELC algorithm, the feedforward control actions are updated by using the tracking error dynamics and the plant-model mismatch problem is thus discarded. Therefore, the feedforward controller gradually eliminates the feedback controller from the control of the system once the mobile robot has been on-track. In addition to the proof of the stability, it is proven that the cost functions do not have local minima so that the coefficients in TELC algorithm guarantee that the global minimum is reached. The experimental results show that the TELC algorithm results in better path tracking performance than the traditional tracking error-based control method. The mobile robot controlled by TELC algorithm can track a target path precisely with less than 10 cm error in off-road terrain.</td>

Among themulti-robot approaches, swarm robotics stresses aspectslike flexibility, scalability and robustness in solving complextasks, and is considered very relevant for precision farmingand large-scale agricultural applications. However, swarmrobotics research is still confined into the lab, and no ap-plication in the field is currently available. In this paper,we describe a roadmap to bring swarm robotics to the fieldwithin the domain of weed control problems. This roadmapis implemented within the experiment SAGA, founded withinthe context of the ECORD++ EU Project. Together with theexperiment concept, we introduce baseline results for thetarget scenario of monitoring and mapping weed in a fieldby means of a swarm of UAVs</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Multi-robot systems (MRS) are a group of robots that are designed<br>aiming to perform some collective behavior. By this collective behavior, some goals<br>that are impossible for a single robot to achieve become feasible and attainable.<br>There are several foreseen benefits of MRS compared to single robot systems such<br>as the increased ability to resolve task complexity, increasing performance, relia-<br>bility and simplicity in design. These benefits have attracted many researchers from<br>academia and industry to investigate how to design and develop robust versatile MRS<br>by solving a number of challenging problems such as complex task allocation, group<br>formation, cooperative object detection and tracking, communication relaying and<br>self-organization to name just a few. One of the most challenging problems of MRS<br>is how to optimally assign a set of robots to a set of tasks in such a way that optimizes<br>the overall system performance subject to a set of constraints. This problem is known<br>as Multi-robot Task Allocation (MRTA) problem. MRTA is a complex problem<br>especially when it comes to heterogeneous unreliable robots equipped with different<br>capabilities that are required to perform various tasks with different requirements<br>and constraints in an optimal way. This chapter provides a comprehensive review on<br>challenging aspects of MRTA problem, recent approaches to tackle this problem and<br>the future directions.</td>

Our approach encompasses robot swarm experiments, microscopic and probabilistic macroscopic-discrete simulations as well as an analytic mathematical model. Following up on previous work, we identify the symmetry parameter, a measure of the progress of the swarm towards a decision, as a fundamental integrated swarm property and formulate its time evolution as a continuous-time Markov process. Contrary to previous work, which justified this approach only empirically and a posteriori, we justify it from first principles and derive hard limits on the parameter regime in which it is applicable.</td>

The special functions are added into the regular ant colony algorithm to improve the selective strategy. When an ant explores a dead-corner in path searching, a dead-corner table is established and a penalty function is used for the trail intensity updated in order to avoid the path deadlock of mobile robot. A behavior strategy on "first come and first service" is adopted to solve the conflict between moving robots in distributed local navigation. Simulation results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the performance of the planned path, and the individual robots with collision-free can achieve to reach their goal locations by the simple local navigation strategies</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Using robots to harvest sweet peppers in protected cropping environments hasremained unsolved despite considerable effort by the research community overseveral decades. In this paper, we present the robotic harvester, Harvey, designedfor sweet peppers in protected cropping environments that achieved a 76.5%success rate on 68 fruit (within a modified scenario) which improves upon our priorwork which achieved 58% on 24 fruit and related sweet pepper harvesting workwhich achieved 33% on 39 fruit (for their best tool in a modified scenario). Thisimprovement was primarily achieved through the introduction of a novel pedunclesegmentation system using an efficient deep convolutional neural network, in con-junction with three‐dimensional postfiltering to detect the critical cutting location.We benchmark the peduncle segmentation against prior art demonstratingan improvement in performance with aF1score of 0.564 compared to 0.302. Therobotic harvester uses a perception pipeline to detect a target sweet pepper and anappropriate grasp and cutting pose used to determine the trajectory of a multimodalharvesting tool to grasp the sweet pepper and cut it from the plant. A noveldecoupling mechanism enables the gripping and cutting operations to be performedindependently. We perform an in‐depth analysis of the full robotic harvesting systemto highlight bottlenecks and failure points that future work could address.</td>

In this research, we develop and evaluate a positioning and orientation system using a sound signal and two different receiver architectures in a greenhouse. The results obtained: a positioning accuracy of 23.0 ± 5.5 mm and average orientation accuracy of 3.43 ± 1.67° and 1.58 ± 0.86° for these two methods, demonstrate this spread spectrum sound based system has the potential to be deployed on small distributed greenhouse robots.</td>

This paper reviews some of the latest achievements in agricultural robotics, specifically those that are used for autonomous weed control, field scouting, and harvesting. Object identification, task planning algorithms, digitalization and optimization of sensors are highlighted as some of the facing challenges in the context of digital farming. The concepts of multi-robots, human-robot collaboration, and environment reconstruction from aerial images and ground-based sensors for the creation of virtual farms were highlighted as some of the gateways of digital farming. It was shown that one of the trends and research focuses in agricultural field robotics is towards building a swarm of small scale robots and drones that collaborate together to optimize farming inputs and reveal denied or concealed information. For the case of robotic harvesting, an autonomous framework with several simple axis manipulators can be faster and more efficient than the currently adapted professional expensive manipulators. While robots are becoming the inseparable parts of the modern farms, our conclusion is that it is not realistic to expect an entirely automated farming system in the future.</td>

To treat the self-navigation (or on-line path planning) of multi-robot system, the hybrid objective functions for target, obstacles, and robots collision avoidance are selected. By the ABC algorithm, the next positions of each robot are designed and then, the tracking control to the planned neighborhood target is done by the PID controllers. Thus, the mobiles robots can travel to the target without collision. Finally, simulation results are introduced to show the effectiveness and performance of the proposed approach.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Swarm intelligence (SI) is concerned with the collective behaviour that emerges from decentralised self-organising systems, whilst swarm robotics (SR) is an approach to the self-coordination of large numbers of simple robots which emerged as the application of SI to multi-robot systems. Given the increasing severity and frequency of occurrence of wildfires and the hazardous nature of fighting their propagation, the use of disposable inexpensive robots in place of humans is of special interest. This paper demonstrates the feasibility and potential of employing SR to fight fires autonomously, with a focus on the self-coordination mechanisms for the desired firefighting behaviour to emerge. Thus, an efficient physics-based model of fire propagation and a self-organisation algorithm for swarms of firefighting drones are developed and coupled, with the collaborative behaviour based on a particle swarm algorithm adapted to individuals operating within physical dynamic environments of high severity and frequency of change. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed self-organising system is effective, scalable and fault-tolerant, comprising a promising approach to dealing with the suppression of wildfires – one of the world's most pressing challenges of our time.</td>

Today, a myriad of real-world scenarios can benefit from the application of robots, such as structural health monitoring, complex manufacturing, efficient logistics or disaster management. Related to this topic, there is a paradigm connected to Swarm Intelligence which is grasping significant interest from the Computational Intelligence community. This branch of knowledge is known as Swarm Robotics, which refers to the development of tools and techniques to ease the coordination of multiple small-sized robots towards the accomplishment of difficult tasks or missions in a collaborative fashion. The success of Swarm Robotics applications comes from the efficient use of smart sensing, communication and organization functionalities endowed to these small robots, which allow for collaborative information sensing, operation and knowledge inference from the environment. The numerous industrial and social applications that can be addressed efficiently by virtue of swarm robotics unleashes a vibrant research area focused on distributing intelligence among autonomous agents with simple behavioral rules and communication schedules, yet potentially capable of realizing the most complex tasks. In this context, we present and overview recent contributions reported around this paradigm, which serves as an exemplary excerpt of the potential of Swarm Robotics to become a major research catalyst of the Computational Intelligence arena in years to come.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Swarm robotics has experienced a rapid expansion in recent years, primarily fueled by<br>specialized multi-robot systems developed to achieve dedicated collective actions. These<br>specialized platforms are, in general, designed with swarming considerations at the front<br>and center. Key hardware and software elements required for swarming are often deeply<br>embedded and integrated with the particular system. However, given the noticeable<br>increase in the number of low-cost mobile robots readily available, practitioners and<br>hobbyists may start considering to assemble full-fledged swarms by minimally retrofitting<br>such mobile platforms with a swarm-enabling technology. Here, we report one possible<br>embodiment of such a technology—an integrated combination of hardware and soft-<br>ware—designed to enable the assembly and the study of swarming in a range of gener-<br>al-purpose robotic systems. This is achieved by combining a modular and transferable<br>software toolbox with a hardware suite composed of a collection of low-cost and off-the-<br>shelf components. The developed technology can be ported to a relatively vast range of<br>robotic platforms—such as land and surface vehicles—with minimal changes and high<br>levels of scalability. This swarm-enabling technology has successfully been implemented<br>on two distinct distributed multi-robot systems, a swarm of mobile marine buoys and a<br>team of commercial terrestrial robots. We have tested the effectiveness of both of these<br>distributed robotic systems in performing collective exploration and search scenarios,<br>as well as other classical cooperative behaviors. Experimental results on different swarm<br>behaviors are reported for the two platforms in uncontrolled environments and without<br>any supporting infrastructure. The design of the associated software library allows for a<br>seamless switch to other cooperative behaviors—e.g., leader–follower heading consen-<br>sus and collision avoidance, and also offers the possibility to simulate newly designed<br>collective behaviors prior to their implementation onto the platforms. This feature greatly<br>facilitates behavior-based design, i.e., the design of new swarming behaviors, with the<br>possibility to simulate them prior to physically test them.</td>
