  abstract = {Swarm intelligence (SI) is concerned with the collective behaviour that emerges from decentralised self-organising systems, whilst swarm robotics (SR) is an approach to the self-coordination of large numbers of simple robots which emerged as the application of SI to multi-robot systems. Given the increasing severity and frequency of occurrence of wildfires and the hazardous nature of fighting their propagation, the use of disposable inexpensive robots in place of humans is of special interest. This paper demonstrates the feasibility and potential of employing SR to fight fires autonomously, with a focus on the self-coordination mechanisms for the desired firefighting behaviour to emerge. Thus, an efficient physics-based model of fire propagation and a self-organisation algorithm for swarms of firefighting drones are developed and coupled, with the collaborative behaviour based on a particle swarm algorithm adapted to individuals operating within physical dynamic environments of high severity and frequency of change. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed self-organising system is effective, scalable and fault-tolerant, comprising a promising approach to dealing with the suppression of wildfires – one of the world's most pressing challenges of our time.},

  abstract = {Collective behaviours such as swarm formations of autonomous agents offer the advantages of efficient movement, redundancy, and potential for human guidance of a single swarm organism. This paper proposes a developmental approach to evolving collective behaviours whereby the evolutionary process is guided by a novel value system. A self-organising map is used at the core of this value system and motion properties of the swarm entities are used as input. Unlike traditional approaches, this value system does not need in advance the precise characteristics of the intended behaviours. We examine the performance of this value system in a series of controlled experiments. Our results demonstrate that the value system can recognise multiple “interesting” structured collective behaviours and distinguish them from random movement patterns. Results show that our value system is most effective distinguishing structured behaviours from random behaviours when using motion properties of individual agents as input. Further variations and modifications to input data such as normalisation and aggregation were also investigated, and it was shown that certain configurations provide better results in distinguishing collective behaviours from random ones.},

  abstract = {Robotics have experienced a meteoric growth over the last decades, reaching unprecedented levels of distributed intelligence and self-autonomy. Today, a myriad of real-world scenarios can benefit from the application of robots, such as structural health monitoring, complex manufacturing, efficient logistics or disaster management. Related to this topic, there is a paradigm connected to Swarm Intelligence which is grasping significant interest from the Computational Intelligence community. This branch of knowledge is known as Swarm Robotics, which refers to the development of tools and techniques to ease the coordination of multiple small-sized robots towards the accomplishment of difficult tasks or missions in a collaborative fashion. The success of Swarm Robotics applications comes from the efficient use of smart sensing, communication and organization functionalities endowed to these small robots, which allow for collaborative information sensing, operation and knowledge inference from the environment. The numerous industrial and social applications that can be addressed efficiently by virtue of swarm robotics unleashes a vibrant research area focused on distributing intelligence among autonomous agents with simple behavioral rules and communication schedules, yet potentially capable of realizing the most complex tasks. In this context, we present and overview recent contributions reported around this paradigm, which serves as an exemplary excerpt of the potential of Swarm Robotics to become a major research catalyst of the Computational Intelligence arena in years to come.},

  abstract = {It is difficult for swarm robots to allocate tasks efficiently by self-organization in a dynamicunknown environment. The computational cost of swarm robots will be significantly increased forlarge-scale tasks, and the unbalanced task allocation of robots will also lead to a decrease in systemefficiency. To address these issues, we propose a dynamic task allocation method of swarm robotsbased on optimal mass transport theory.  The problem of large-scale tasks is solved by groupingswarm robots to complete regional tasks.  The task reallocation mechanism realizes the balancedtask allocation of individual robots.  This paper solves the symmetric assignment between robotand task and between the robot groups and the regional tasks.  Our simulation and experimentalresults demonstrate that the proposed method can make the swarm robots self-organize to allocatelarge-scale dynamic tasks effectively. The tasks can also be balanced allocated to each robot in theswarm of robots.},

  abstract = {The use of aerial swarms to solve real-world problems has been increasing steadily, accompanied by falling prices and improving performance of communication, sensing, and processing hardware. The commoditization of hardware has reduced unit costs, thereby lowering the barriers to entry to the field of aerial swarm robotics. A key enabling technology for swarms is the family of algorithms that allow the individual members of the swarm to communicate and allocate tasks amongst themselves, plan their trajectories, and coordinate their flight in such a way that the overall objectives of the swarm are achieved efficiently. These algorithms, often organized in a hierarchical fashion, endow the swarm with autonomy at every level, and the role of a human operator can be reduced, in principle, to interactions at a higher level without direct intervention. This technology depends on the clever and innovative application of theoretical tools from control and estimation. This paper reviews the state of the art of these theoretical tools, specifically focusing on how they have been developed for, and applied to, aerial swarms. Aerial swarms differ from swarms of ground-based vehicles in two respects: they operate in a three-dimensional space and the dynamics of individual vehicles adds an extra layer of complexity. We review dynamic modeling and conditions for stability and controllability that are essential in order to achieve cooperative flight and distributed sensing. The main sections of this paper focus on major results covering trajectory generation, task allocation, adversarial control, distributed sensing, monitoring, and mapping. Wherever possible, we indicate how the physics and subsystem technologies of aerial robots are brought to bear on these individual areas.},

  abstract = {An alternative to deploying a single robot of high complexity can be to utilise robot swarms comprising large numbers of identical, and much simpler, robots. Such swarms have been shown to be adaptable, fault-tolerant and widely applicable. However, designing individual robot algorithms to ensure effective and correct overall swarm behaviour is actually very difficult. While mechanisms for assessing the effectiveness of any swarm algorithm before deployment are essential, such mechanisms have traditionally involved either computational simulations of swarm behaviour, or experiments with robot swarms themselves. However, such simulations or experiments cannot, by their nature, analyse all possible swarm behaviours. In this paper, we will develop and apply the use of automated probabilistic formal verification techniques to robot swarms, involving an exhaustive mathematical analysis, in order to assess whether swarms will indeed behave as required. In particular we consider a foraging robot scenario to which we apply probabilistic model checking.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization algorithm with enhanced exploration and exploitation, named as “heterogeneous comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization” (HCLPSO). In this algorithm, the swarm population is divided into two subpopulations. Each subpopulation is assigned to focus solely on either exploration or exploitation. Comprehensive learning (CL) strategy is used to generate the exemplars for both subpopulations. In the exploration-subpopulation, the exemplars are generated by using personal best experiences of the particles in the exploration-subpopulation itself. In the exploitation-subpopulation, the personal best experiences of the entire swarm population are used to generate the exemplars. As the exploration-subpopulation does not learn from any particles in the exploitation-subpopulation, the diversity in the exploration-subpopulation can be retained even if the exploitation-subpopulation converges prematurely. The heterogeneous comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization algorithm is tested on shifted and rotated benchmark problems and compared with other recent particle swarm optimization algorithms to demonstrate superior performance of the proposed algorithm over other particle swarm optimization variants.},
