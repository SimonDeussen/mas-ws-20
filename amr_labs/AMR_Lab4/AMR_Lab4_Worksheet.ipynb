    "An optical encoder wheel is used to detect the rotations of the robots wheels. The data from the encoder wheel sensors are fed into a [HCTL-2000](data/HTCL-20XX-family-datasheet.pdf) IC which then counts the number of \"ticks\" completed by the wheel. The controller then reads this tick count from the HTCL-2000 and uses them to model the robots movements.\n",

In the dat file the left hand column is represents the left wheel, and the right hand column the right wheel. The total number of ticks is read at 100Hz and the counter is never reset, i.e. the measurements are cumulative. Finally plot the speed of the left and right angular velocities over time."

The wheel angular velocities are 1.0 rad/s and 2.0 rad/s for the left and right wheels respectively. The robot has a base line (b) of 15cm and wheel radii ($r_w$) of 2.5cm. Use an update time of 0.1 seconds i.e. $\\Delta t = 0.1$ and cycle until $t_{total} = 3$. You should have a final location of approx. $[0.095, 0.211]$ m and orientation of -0.3 rad. Hint: You may find it easier to create a class with an state update function."
